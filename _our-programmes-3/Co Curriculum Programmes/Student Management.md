<br>1. “One team, Springfield!” Our Springfield Floorball team (Boys) started
in 2012. The training sessions and activities are designed to foster a
sense of belonging in the team, build their resilience and nurture good
sportsmanship.
<br>
<br>2. Students will undergo tough physical training and skills training.
As they improve their stamina and endurance, they will also develop their
character in terms of leadership, discipline, teamwork, and resilience.
<br>
<br>3. The Floorball team is looking for students who have played the sport
in Primary schools. Those without prior experience are also welcomed to
try out for the team and they will be put through a series of tests.
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Students will get to represent the school in National Schools Competition
and other external competitions. There will be camps, overseas trips and
floorball clinics organised for students to forge strong bonds and develop
21st Century Competencies.</p>
