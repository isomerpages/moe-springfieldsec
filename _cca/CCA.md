# **CCA**
### Aims of our CCA Programme

*   Our programme aims to give a more complete and balanced education. It teaches our pupil through informal instruction, the values of sharing, teamwork co-operation, friendship and other qualities which are essential in character-building for the sake of self and nation-building.   
    
*   Pupils with special talents or potential in these areas of interests will be nurtured and guided to attain higher levels of achievement and to win glory and honour for themselves, their families and even our nation.   
    
*   We would like to develop in each of our pupils a life-long skill or an area of interest that he or she could pursue as a life-long recreational activity.   
    
*   CCA participation is COMPULSORY. All students must have at least one CCA and they are not allowed to change their CCA without the permission of the Principal or HOD/CCA   
    
*   As required by Ministry of Education’s CCA policy, the School Band, National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) are mandatory CCAs for all secondary schools. Pupils in these CCAs are not permitted t change their CCA during their school years except for medical reasons.

  

**CCA Attachment & Allocation Policy**

1\. After the CCA Engagement Sessions during the Start-It-Right Program, Students will indicate which CCA they wish to join.

2\. Following which, the student will attend the CCA Selection the following week. HOD PECCA will generate the name list based on CCAs and pass this list to the Classes and CCA Teachers. Form Teachers will assist to inform the students which CCA they have to attend.

3\. At the session, CCA Teacher will select and inform the students if they are in the CCA or not.

4\. If the student is _**NOT selected**_, the CCA Teacher will then assist the student in choosing their next choice and update the Google Document that is being shared.

5\. If the student _**is selected**_, he or she may attend CCA immediately. However, if they wish to still try out for our CCAs before making an informed decision, they are allowed to. However, please note that once they choose not to accept the offer, they might lose their spot.

6\. If CCA Teachers would like to keep-in-view the student, he or she may do so but have to make a decision till end of the Week. This is to also allow the other students not selected from other CCAs to attend another CCA of their choice too. 

7\. Each CCA has a quota and once they reached their quota, they will not be able to recruit any more new members. Students are required to contribute to the CCA, work with their friends and learn new skills.

8\. The above process is repeated for a whole month (31st January 2020) until Students finalise their CCA. After which, they will be allocated a CCA.

Please note that the CCA Schedule can be found at the links below.

Please also note that Consent Forms will be given once the student has confirmed his or her CCA.
