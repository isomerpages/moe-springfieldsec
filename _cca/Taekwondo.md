<p>The Springfield Taekwondo team trains regularly to sharpen their techniques,
build resilience, and strive for excellence. Guided by Coach Joyce Lim
and Coach Cheryl Ng, the team worked hard and achieved commendable results
at the National School Games (NSG) 2025, proudly bringing home medals for
the school.</p>
<p>Beyond competitions, the team also showcases their skills and spirit through
performances at school events such as Awards Day, Alumni Homecoming, and
Chinese New Year celebrations. These aerobic and skills-based demonstrations
reflect their discipline, teamwork, and passion for the sport.</p>
<p>Our Taekwondo members also take part in annual Values in Action (VIA)
programmes, where they contribute to the community while nurturing empathy,
kindness, respect, and responsibility. In addition, day camps held twice
a year provide opportunities for bonding, character-building, and sharpening
of skills.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, students who join Taekwondo become more disciplined,
physically fit, strong-minded, and resilient individuals — growing not
only as athletes, but also as leaders with character and heart.</p>

<p>‘Tae’ means to kick or smash with the feet, ‘Kwon’ implies punching or
destroying with the hands or fists and ‘Do’ means the art or the way. Hence,
Taekwondo, a Korean phraseology, literally means the art of foot and hand
fighting.
<br>
<br>In Springfield members of the Taekwondo team train regularly to learn
new skills and sharpen their techniques. Under the guidance of their coach,
Coach Joyce Lim, Coach Pauline Lim and Coach Cheryl Ng, the members of
the school Taekwondo team trained hard and took part in National Inter-School
Championships and achieved very commendable success.
<br>
<br>The Springfield Taekwondo team were elated as Kyorugi (sparring) resumes
again for National School Games (NSG) 2023. The team managed to push through
each training and continue to work hard for NSG. We are proud to come home
with medals and trophies from the competition.
<br>
<br>“The team was determined to overcome the challenges right in front of
us. The team has become more focused and committed to strive to not only
become a better and stronger team, but also a closely knit family of people
working towards a common goal. As a team, we strive to be the best. “Teamwork
is the secret that makes common people achieve uncommon results.” – Captains
and Vice-captains of Taekwondo 2023.
