**OUR MISSION AND VISION**  

The **MISSION** of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active and community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe. 

The **VISION** of the National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world

**OUR BELIEFS**

In accordance with our mission and observing our objectives, we believe in:

*   **Developing Leaders with Character & Values** 
    
    **ENSURE** our growth by exposing us to a challenging environment, which, in turn will imbibe us with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.
   

*   **Building Bonds with SPF** 
    
**ENLIGHTEN** us on the role of the Singapore Police Force, help to build a stronger bond of friendship with them, and so lead to a safer place for all in the country.

*   **Showing Care & Concern to Others** 
    
As part of a culture that encourages us to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, **TEACH** us to extend the same care and concern to others.

*   **Facing Challenges & Achieving Excellence** 
    
As a result of our identification with the Singapore Police Force, **TEACH** us to adopt its tradition of high standards of performance, commitment, duty and service, to seek to excel and to face up to challenge.  

National Police Cadet Corps was formed in 1959 and has a membership of about 20,000 cadets in 157 secondary schools, 2 polytechnics and 2 universities. 

Springfield Secondary's NPCC (Sea) Unit was launched in January 2003 and is the longest running NPCC (Sea) unit in Singapore. We conduct a wide variety of activities for the cadets to develop them into caring and responsible pupils.

The National Police Cadet Corps requires students who love outdoor activities and enjoy working together as a team. They will enjoy camaraderie between squad mates, and have their seniors supporting and being there for them. They can look forward to forging long lasting bonds with their fellow squad mates as they take part in activities which are fulfilling, challenging and rewarding.
