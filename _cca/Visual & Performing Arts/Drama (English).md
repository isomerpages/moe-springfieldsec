This training will not only prepare students to represent the school at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) competition; it will, more importantly, develop the students into confident and outspoken individuals through other intra-school and external performances as well. The programme offered by the Drama Club includes:


* warm-ups 
* vocal training and diction 
* breathing techniques 
* modes of performance 
* working with the script

* acting: character role and development 
* improvisation 
* blocking and staging 
* directing
* props making
* lights and sounds stage management
