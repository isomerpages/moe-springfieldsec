**Our Motto** 

Nothing is impossible; it's all in the mind! 

**Our Vision** 

To be a strong and united band working hand-in-hand towards musicality and disciplinary excellence.

**Our Band** 

The Springfield Secondary School Band was founded in 1993 and has a current strength of about 50 members. 

Despite its small size, Springfield Band has always stood strong and united as they uphold their motto 'Nothing is impossible, it's all in the mind'.

In the 2012 Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging for Display Bands, Springfield's Drum Major won the highest honour of any Drum Major in a Band SYF competition - the 

‘Drum Major of the Year 2012 Award’. 

In 2014 SYF, we have also clinched both the “Best Music Performance 2014” and “Certificate of Accomplishment 2014”.
