<p>The Netball girls are a closely knitted family that have gone through
many activities and camps. Through the sport, the girls learn the importance
of discipline, commitment, integrity and teamwork. As a netballer, the
girls get to participate in a number of activities, competitions and camps
which allow them to develop their leadership qualities, organizing skills,
competitive spirit and improve their fitness level.</p>
<p>For many years, the Netball Girls have organized the annual Springfield
Netball Carnival which many other Secondary Schools participated in. During
the carnival, Netballers from various schools exchange pointers, build
ties and forge friendships with each other. They learn how to work under
constraints and overcoming the challenges faced. The Netball girls have
also served the needs of the community. They have raised awareness of the
less privileged and have actively participated in Values-in-action programme
at All Saints Home. This helps to nurture socially responsible citizens
who can contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning
and application of values, knowledge and skills​.</p>
