The Netball girls are a closely knitted family that has gone through many activities and camps. Through the sport, the Girls learn the importance of discipline, commitment, integrity and teamwork. As a Netballer, the Girls get to participate in a number of activities, competitions and camps which allow them to develop their leadership qualities, organizing skills, competitive spirit and improve their fitness level.  
  
For many years, the Netball Girls have organized the Springfield Netball Carnival which many other Secondary Schools participated in. During the carnival, Netballers from various schools exchange pointers, build ties and forge friendships with each other. They learn how to work under constraints and overcoming the challenges faced.  
  
The Netball Girls also care for the environment by co-organizing a Love Your Food Campaign together with the Springfield Environment Committee to promote and reduce food wastage. Through this programme, the raise awareness among the Students about ways on how it can be achieved and the impact of food wastage on the climate.
