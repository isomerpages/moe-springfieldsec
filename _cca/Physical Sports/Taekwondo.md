'Tae' means to kick or smash with the feet, 'Kwon' implies punching or destroying with the hands or fists and 'Do' means the art or the way. Hence, Taekwondo, a Korean phraseology, literally means the art of foot and hand fighting. 

From 2010 onwards, Taekwondo will be included in the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) and Singapore Primary Schools Sports Council (SPSSC) calendar. The acceptance of Taekwondo as an inter-school sport has further enhance the status of the sport.

In Springfield members of the Taekwondo team train regularly to learn new skills and sharpen their techniques. Under the guidance of their coach, Mr Tan Cheng Hui, the members of the school Taekwondo team trained hard and took part in National Inter-School Championships and achieved very commendable success.
