<h1>PLD Matters</h1>
<p>As part of MOE’s Personalised Digital Learning Programme, all secondary
school students are issued a school prescribed Personal Learning Device,
PLD.</p>
<p>The PLD supports teaching and learning in and beyond the classroom. It
enables students to access digital resources, collaborate with peers, and
engage in interactive learning experiences.</p>
<p>Through the use of PLDs, students learn to:</p>

<h4><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>An MOE Device Management Application has been installed on all students’
PLDs. The DMA provides a safer digital environment for learning and supports
both the school and parents in guiding students’ device use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>In School Settings, 6.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m.</u></strong>
</p>
<p>During school hours, default DMA settings apply:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access to undesirable internet content is blocked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only selected applications prescribed by the school are accessible</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>After School Hours, 3.00 p.m to 10.30 p.m</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may choose one of the following options:</p>

<p>Please note:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<h4><strong>PLD Technical Support</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>💻 Reporting Device Issues, Hardware Faults or Damages</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student should bring the device to the ICT Team at Computer Lab 1
for diagnostic assessment and checking of warranty/insurance validity.
<br><em>(For students using the ASUS Chromebook, JK Technology provides only on-site collection services. The ICT Team will advise if this arrangement is possible, on a case-by-case basis.)</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please note that the ICT Team is <u>not</u> able to carry out major or extensive
repairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If necessary, the ICT Team will advise the student to bring the device
to the vendor’s service centre for repair.</p>
</li>

<p><strong><u>💻 Reporting Lost Devices</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Parents are required to make a police report for the lost device.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents should contact the device contractor directly via their helpdesk
or service centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the police report must be submitted to the vendor for insurance
claims, this applies only if the device is still within the insurance coverage

</li>
<li>
<p>The vendor’s helpdesk or service centre will advise parents on the insurance
claim process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents/students should also inform the school’s ICT Team at Computer
Lab to arrange for the device to be remotely locked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, we believe that digital literacy must
be accompanied by strong values and responsible decision making. <strong>The PLD is a powerful learning tool, and students must learn to use it wisely, respectfully, and safely.</strong>
</p>
<p>To support this, the school intentionally educates students on cyber wellness
through assembly talks, school-wide programmes, and <a href="https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/programmes/cce-programme/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">structured CCE lessons</a>,
equipping them with the knowledge and judgment to navigate the digital
world responsibly.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>
<br>Together with the school, parents play a vital role in shaping responsible
digital habits. You can support your child by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Having regular conversations about their online experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting clear expectations for appropriate device use at home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing screen free times, especially before bedtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring online behaviour in age appropriate ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modelling respectful and responsible digital behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When schools and parents work together, students develop not just digital
skills, but the judgement and character to use technology well.</p>
