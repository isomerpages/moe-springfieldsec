<h1><strong>Home School Partnership</strong></h1>
<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>Springfield Secondary School is committed to build a positive partnership
with parents in order to develop our students as <strong>Future-Ready Learners with a Caring Heart and the Confidence to Lead</strong>,
who are grounded in our <strong>STRIDE school values of Service, Tenacity, Respect, Integrity, Diligence and Empathy</strong>.
We need to prepare them to be adaptable and resilient, to be able to respect
differences and embrace diversity; in so doing, let us work together to
live out our school motto of <strong>‘Better Self for Better Tomorrow’</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to have better home-school partnership, we hope the following
guidelines provide greater clarity on how we can work hand-in-hand to help
our students have ownership over their learning, develop a sense of purpose
and success in life.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To instill <strong>personal responsibility and independence</strong> in
our students, teachers will communicate <strong>directly</strong> with them
on matters pertaining to schoolwork/ CCA, e.g., homework to be done, materials
to be brought to school etc. We encourage parents to check in with your
child/ ward on these and have them seek assistance <strong>directly </strong>from
teachers if necessary.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents will be kept informed of school events and student attendance,
HBL days etc. via notices sent out through <strong>Parents Gateway (PG)</strong>.
Teachers may also contact you to discuss support for or well-being of your
child/ward. If there is a need, parents may use the following channels
to reach teachers:
<br>• School General Office: 6318 3053
<br>• School Email: springfields@moe.edu.sg
<br>• Specific Teacher’s Email that can be found at: <a href="https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/our-organisation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/our-organisation/</a>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also check with your child’s/ward’s teacher on the best way to
contact him/her.</p>

<p>The school will endeavour to respond to your inquiry within a day or two
for straightforward matters. Queries that require checking or further investigation
may take longer (3- 5 working days). We would appreciate your understanding
that there may be a delay should the teacher be away or on leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointments to meet with teachers should preferably be made at least
three days in advance during the school term. Parents may call the General
Office, email the school, or contact the teacher directly to make the appointment.</p>
