<h1><strong>Springfield Parents' Network (SPN)</strong></h1>
<p>The Springfield Parents Network (SPN) is a dedicated community of parents
who believe that every child thrives when families and schools work hand
in hand. Guided by the core pillars of Collaboration, Support, and Appreciation,
the SPN brings parents together to forge meaningful partnerships with the
school, walk alongside one another in the parenting journey, and show gratitude
to the teachers and staff who nurture our children daily. Together, we
build a caring community where every Springfield student can flourish.</p>
