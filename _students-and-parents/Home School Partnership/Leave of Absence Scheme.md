<h1><strong>Leave of Absence Scheme</strong></h1>
<p>The Leave of Absence (LOA) scheme allows your child to rejoin their school
after they return from overseas.</p>
<p>If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student
of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after
returning to Singapore.</p>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>LOA applies to all Singapore Citizens (SC) and Permanent Resident (PR)
children in primary school, secondary school, junior colleges and Millennia
Institute.</p>
<p>To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all three of the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An SC or PR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presently studying in a Singapore school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining
their school after returning to Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
