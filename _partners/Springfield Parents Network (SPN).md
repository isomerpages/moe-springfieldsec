# **Springfield Parents' Network (SPN)**

Schools and Parents must work hand in hand to support the child's learning and be successful in life. The Springfield Parents' Network (SPN) is always supporting the School in nurturing and developing confident individuals into lifelong learners.  
  
Family Days, Parent-Child Bonding activities, Termly Meetings, Sharing Sessions, participation in school based activities were planned and conducted to encourage strong bonding between parents, pupils and staff of the school.

In 2020, most of the SPN activities had to be shelved due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, meeting with the School Leaders and Teachers via Zoom were conducted to ensure communication. Besides that, the SPN members met in small groups to plan out on several activities such as the Teacher's Day and Graduation Day.  
  
For Teacher's Day this year, the SPN gifted every Teacher with a personalized pen pouch. For the Graduating Classes, the SPN sponsored key chains as well as a hand-made graduating pen.
