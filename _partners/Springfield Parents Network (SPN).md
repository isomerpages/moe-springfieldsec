In 2020, most of the SPN activities had to be shelved due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, meeting with the School Leaders and Teachers via Zoom were conducted to ensure communication. Besides that, the SPN members met in small groups to plan out on several activities such as the Teacher's Day and Graduation Day.  
  
For Teacher's Day this year, the SPN gifted every Teacher with a personalized pen pouch. For the Graduating Classes, the SPN sponsored key chains as well as a hand-made graduating pen.
