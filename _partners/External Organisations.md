### Darul Ghufran Mosque

**Mr. Ahmad Khushairi Bin Abidin, Head of Youth & Family Development Department**

"Darul Ghufran Mosque's mission is to provide value-added programs for the community. We have forged a very good relationship with Springfield Secondary School from the principal, to the teachers, and to the students. The values of spreading blessings to all and forging a strong relationship with our stakeholders have been a key for the program to be a success. A million thanks to the school for the trust, support, and opportunity given. There's a saying - it takes a community to raise a child."

We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to Springfield Secondary School for their support in the various community activities. This collaboration platform gives the students opportunities to learn and contribute to the community. Experiences and reflection in the community activities enable the students to link what they have learned in the classroom with real-life applications that go beyond the academic subjects. We greatly appreciate the support, and look forward to continuing our partnership well into the future.
