### Darul Ghufran Mosque

**Mr. Ahmad Khushairi Bin Abidin, Head of Youth & Family Development Department**

"Darul Ghufran Mosque's mission is to provide value-added programs for the community. We have forged a very good relationship with Springfield Secondary School from the principal, to the teachers, and to the students. The values of spreading blessings to all and forging a strong relationship with our stakeholders have been a key for the program to be a success. A million thanks to the school for the trust, support, and opportunity given. There's a saying - it takes a community to raise a child."
