To me, Springfield is my second home, where I have gained not only knowledge but memories which I still treasure till today. Springfield has given me many opportunities to allow myself to grow and at the same time discover what are my interests. This is the pivotal point of my education path and I was able to make a clear decision on what I want to pursue in my tertiary education. Lastly, with the character building programmes that Springfield has arranged for my fellow peers and me, we learnt the importance of good character which is an essential skill in today's society.Â 

I graduated from Springfield in 2012 and went to Yishun Junior College where I took my A-Levels in 2014. Now I am currently serving National Service and I will be studying Chemistry at NUS after my National Service. My dream is to work in the Singapore Police Force so that I can repay society and keep our neighbourhood safe.

To the current Springfielders, don't let anything stop you from achieving! Remember that there is always a way out of the storm no matter how gloomy it may seem, believe in yourself and strive!
