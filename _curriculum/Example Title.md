<h1>Craft &amp; Technology Department</h1>
<h2>Department Vision</h2>
<p>• Inquisitive Learners, Creative Innovators</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Department Mission</h2>
<p>• To develop learners with an appreciation for design, art and culture,
who are creative and resourceful when solving problems.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Department Direction</h2>
<p>Our department is committed to nurturing <strong>inquisitive learners and creative innovators</strong> who
can thrive in an ever-evolving world. By nurturing in Springfielders an
appreciation for <strong>design, art, and culture</strong>, we aim to develop
students who are not only <strong>creative and resourceful problem-solvers</strong> but
also adaptable thinkers. In a <strong>BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Non-linear, and Incomprehensible)</strong> world,
the ability to <strong>think critically, embrace innovation, and apply design thinking</strong> is
essential. Our approach equips students with the skills and mindset to
navigate challenges with confidence, ensuring they remain <strong>resilient, adaptable, and forward-thinking</strong> in
an increasingly dynamic environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Art Unit</u>
</p>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, we believe Art is a way of seeing, thinking
and being. Through making and responding to artworks, students engage with
three big ideas that shape the discipline:</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art helps us see in new ways</em>,</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art tells stories about our world</em>, and</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art influences how we live</em>.</p>
<p>These ideas guide our students in connecting personal expression to broader
cultural and societal narratives.</p>
<p>
<br>In Lower Secondary, all students undertake a two-year journey in Art that
cultivates curiosity, creativity, and confidence. Lessons are centred on
exploration and meaning-making across media, contexts, and themes. Students
engage in two <strong>Core Learning Experiences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CLE1:</strong><em> Making Thinking Visible with Drawing</em>,
where drawing is used as a tool for observing, visualising, and ideating,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CLE2:</strong><em> Learning with Portfolio</em>, which supports
self-reflection and sustained learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In Upper Secondary, students who choose to pursue Art deepen their inquiry
and skill development through electives at the G1, G2, or G3 level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>G1 Art focuses on <strong>CLE1:</strong><em> </em>Building Portfolios and <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Design
Immersion, allowing students to explore design concepts and connect art
to lived experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G2 and G3 Art students engage in <strong>CLE1:</strong><em> </em>Building
Portfolios, <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Art Journalling, and <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Art
Conversations, where students cultivate personal voice, artistic discipline,
and the confidence to respond critically to visual culture.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our programme aspires to nurture thoughtful, expressive, and culturally
grounded learners who are ready to shape the world through the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Design &amp; Technology Unit</u>
</p>
<p>In <strong>Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>, students are exposed
to opportunities for them to develop skills and competencies which are
inherent in design practices through designing and making. The design process
in D&amp;T is the key platform for students to make meaning of their learning,
facilitated by their teachers.</p>
<p>The dispositions that promote design thinking are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>embrace uncertainties and complexities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>to be cognisant of and resolve real-world and complex problems</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>relentless drive to seek out how things work</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>to use doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
