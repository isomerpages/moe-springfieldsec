<h1>Craft &amp; Technology Department</h1>
<h2>Department Vision</h2>
<p>• Inquisitive Learners, Creative Innovators</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Department Mission</h2>
<p>• To develop learners with an appreciation for design, art and culture,
who are creative and resourceful when solving problems.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Department Direction</h2>
<p>Our department is committed to nurturing <strong>inquisitive learners and creative innovators</strong> who
can thrive in an ever-evolving world. By nurturing in Springfielders an
appreciation for <strong>design, art, and culture</strong>, we aim to develop
students who are not only <strong>creative and resourceful problem-solvers</strong> but
also adaptable thinkers. In a <strong>BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Non-linear, and Incomprehensible)</strong> world,
the ability to <strong>think critically, embrace innovation, and apply design thinking</strong> is
essential. Our approach equips students with the skills and mindset to
navigate challenges with confidence, ensuring they remain <strong>resilient, adaptable, and forward-thinking</strong> in
an increasingly dynamic environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3><u>Art Unit</u></h3>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, we believe Art is a way of seeing, thinking
and being. Through making and responding to artworks, students engage with
three big ideas that shape the discipline:</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art helps us see in new ways</em>,</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art tells stories about our world</em>, and</p>
<p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Art influences how we live</em>.</p>
<p>These ideas guide our students in connecting personal expression to broader
cultural and societal narratives.</p>
<p>
<br>In Lower Secondary, all students undertake a two-year journey in Art that
cultivates curiosity, creativity, and confidence. Lessons are centred on
exploration and meaning-making across media, contexts, and themes. Students
engage in two <strong>Core Learning Experiences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CLE1:</strong><em> Making Thinking Visible with Drawing</em>,
where drawing is used as a tool for observing, visualising, and ideating,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CLE2:</strong><em> Learning with Portfolio</em>, which supports
self-reflection and sustained learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In Upper Secondary, students who choose to pursue Art deepen their inquiry
and skill development through electives at the G1, G2, or G3 level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>G1 Art focuses on <strong>CLE1:</strong><em> </em>Building Portfolios and <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Design
Immersion, allowing students to explore design concepts and connect art
to lived experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G2 and G3 Art students engage in <strong>CLE1:</strong><em> </em>Building
Portfolios, <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Art Journalling, and <strong>CLE2:</strong><em> </em>Art
Conversations, where students cultivate personal voice, artistic discipline,
and the confidence to respond critically to visual culture.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our programme aspires to nurture thoughtful, expressive, and culturally
grounded learners who are ready to shape the world through the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><u>Design &amp; Technology Unit</u></h3>
<p>In <strong>Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>, students are exposed
to opportunities for them to develop skills and competencies which are
inherent in design practices through designing and making. The design process
in D&amp;T is the key platform for students to make meaning of their learning,
facilitated by their teachers.</p>
<p>The dispositions that promote design thinking are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>embrace uncertainties and complexities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>to be cognisant of and resolve real-world and complex problems</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>relentless drive to seek out how things work</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>to use doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In <strong>Lower Secondary D&amp;T</strong>, students focus on the development
of freehand sketching skills through idea generation and development and
offer tactile learning experiences for pupils to construct prototypes of
the developed ideas. The Lower Secondary D&amp;T programme enable students
to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cultivate visual-spatial thinking through sketching, experimenting and
prototyping using appropriate materials and basic hand tools/equipment/machines
safely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appreciation of function, aesthetics and technology in design
through everyday products and their implication on sustainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise judgements for design appropriateness with respect to the users,
functionality and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop confidence and pride through turning ideas into physical objects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Upper Secondary D&amp;T</strong>, students dive deeper into
designing and making, doing research to understand and define user needs,
explore and develop design solutions, and prototype their ideas using basic
hand tools/equipment/machines. The Upper Secondary D&amp;T programme enable
students to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>develop confidence, pride and tenacity through exploring real world design
opportunities for which ideas are developed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the quality of mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity through improving
aspects of their environment in everyday life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embrace complexities, uncertainties and the inherent social dimension
of the design process when designing design opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate thinking through doodling and sketching/drawing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experiment and prototype ideas using appropriate materials and tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build on their innate curiosity and ability to create</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise judgements and make evidence-based decisions of technological,
aesthetic and economic nature</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Music Unit</u></h3>
<p>The Music Programme is thoughtfully designed to <strong>develop every student’s musical capacity to express themselves confidently and meaningfully</strong>.
Our curriculum focuses on nurturing critical listening, creative expression,
cultural appreciation, and collaborative performance—core competencies
that support the Stage 4 Learning Outcomes outlined in the National Music
Syllabus.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 1: Foundational Musical Understanding and Rhythmic Creativity</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Secondary 1, students begin their musical journey by exploring the <strong>basic elements of music</strong>,
with a strong emphasis on <strong>meter and rhythm</strong>. Through engaging
hands-on lessons, they learn to compose <strong>8-bar rhythmic pieces</strong> using
body percussion and key musical elements such as <strong>solo, accompaniment, ostinato, call and response</strong>,
and <strong>unison</strong>.</p>
<p>Students also develop their ability to <strong>improvise and perform collaboratively</strong>,
honing group coordination and expressive timing. These learning experiences
cultivate <strong>tenacity and diligence</strong>, aligning with both our <strong>school values</strong> and
MOE’s Stage 4 Learning Outcome 2, which encourages students to express
musical ideas and respond to others in an ensemble setting.</p>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 2: Ensemble Performance and Cultural Exploration</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Secondary 2, students deepen their musical skills by learning to <strong>perform in three-part mixed ensembles</strong>,
incorporating both voice and instruments such as the <strong>ukulele and keyboard</strong>.
Emphasis is placed on <strong>tone production, expressive phrasing</strong>,
and <strong>technical accuracy</strong>.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to <strong>explore music across cultures and genres</strong>,
broadening their appreciation for diverse musical traditions. This aligns
with MOE’s Stage 4 Learning Outcome 1, where students are expected to demonstrate
awareness and appreciation of music in local and global contexts. These
experiences also support the <strong>Desired Outcomes of Education</strong>,
as students become <strong>self-directed learners</strong> who take ownership
of their learning and engage in creative expression.</p>
<p><strong><u>Developing Musical Literacy and Contextual Understanding</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Across both levels, students are introduced to essential <strong>musical concepts</strong> and
encouraged to apply these in real contexts. In Secondary 1, students learn
to <strong>analyse music using appropriate musical terminology</strong>,
identifying elements such as rhythm, texture, form, and timbre. In Secondary
2, they explore the <strong>historical and cultural background of selected songs</strong>,
enhancing both their analytical and interpretive abilities.</p>
<p>These components support students in developing the ability to <strong>understand, appreciate, and perform music with contextual and stylistic awareness</strong>,
in line with the expectations of <strong>MOE’s Stage 4 Learning Outcome 2</strong>.</p>
<h3><u>Nutrition &amp; Food Science Unit</u></h3>
<p>The <strong>Food and Consumer Education (FCE)</strong> programme for lower
secondary students focuses on nurturing health-conscious and discerning
consumers. It equips them with crucial life skills in food and nutrition,
alongside practical consumer education. Through engaging activities, students
learn to advocate for sustainable food consumption by making informed food
choices and applying culinary science principles creatively in food preparation.
This approach cultivates critical thinking and develops creative problem-solving
abilities.</p>
<p>Building on the FCE foundation, the upper secondary elective <strong>Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS)</strong> deepens
students' understanding of nutrition, food science, and sustainable food
consumption. NFS emphasizes knowledge, skills, and attitudes vital for
21st-century competencies. This is achieved through authentic, real-world
applications, including:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applying food science principles
in food preparation</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; developing hands-on practical
skills and conducting food experiments</p>
<p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modifying recipes and planning
meals</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both FCE and NFS students will get the opportunity to participate in industry
learning journeys to food manufacturing facilities or culinary institutes,
offering insights into real-world applications of food science. Students
can further hone their skills through external cooking competitions, providing
a dynamic platform to apply their knowledge and creativity.</p>
