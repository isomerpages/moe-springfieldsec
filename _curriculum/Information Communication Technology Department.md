<h1><strong>Information Communication Technology Department</strong></h1>
<h2>Department Vision</h2>
<p>Transformative Teaching and Learning Experiences, Future Ready Learners
and Innovators.</p>
<h2>Department Mission</h2>
<p>The Springfield ICT Department aims to nurture students to become:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Self-directed learners who leverage technology to enhance independent learning.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Connected learners who continuously learn and share knowledge through online networks.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Digital learners who are adept at navigating the digital literacies of Find, Think, Apply, and Create.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In alignment with the <strong>MOE EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong>, the
Springfield ICT Department implements a range of programmes to strengthen
students’ attainment in <strong>digital literacy and technological skills</strong>,
enabling them to learn effectively across all subjects. At Springfield
Secondary, students are equipped with essential skills such as productivity
and self-management tools, empowering them to make the most of their <strong>Personal Learning Devices</strong> (PLDs)
to support and extend their learning beyond the classroom. These skills
enable students to work more efficiently, collaborate meaningfully, and
manage their own learning, nurturing them to become self-directed and connected
learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond foundational digital competencies, Springfield customises learning
experiences to develop students’ <strong>computational thinking</strong>, <strong>critical thinking</strong>,
and <strong>problem-solving</strong>  <strong>abilities</strong>. Through
applied learning opportunities—such as coding, robotics, and project-based
tasks—students learn to break down complex problems, design logical solutions,
and apply creative approaches to real-world challenges. These experiences
are designed not only to strengthen students’ capacity to “<strong>Find, Think, Apply, and Create</strong>,”
but also to foster adaptability and resilience in a fast-changing technological
landscape.
<br>
</p>
<p>By integrating these digital and technological skills into the school
curriculum, the ICT Department ensures that students are well-prepared
to navigate the demands of the future workplace and society. This approach
aims to nurture responsible and confident learners who can succeed in a
technology-driven world.</p>
