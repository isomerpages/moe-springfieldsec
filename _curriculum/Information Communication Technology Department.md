<h3>Department Programmes:</h3>
<p>In alignment with the National Digital Literacy Programme's (NDLP) aim
to strengthen students' digital literacy in order for them to be future-ready,

<p>To support the Personalised Learning Environment, students will access
self-paced&nbsp;</p>
<p>SLS lessons on&nbsp;New Media Literacy and attend engagement sessions
to develop their dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital
environment.</p>
<p>The New Media Literacy programme aims to equip students with the competencies

<p>In Springfield, the Lower Secondary students will attend a series of coding
lessons to develop them computational thinking skills and seed their interest
for the one of the most important languages of the future, i.e. programming.</p>
<p>As part of STEM (<em>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics</em>)
education, students will have the hands-on experience on robot (<em>mBots</em>)
programming using block-based programming.</p>
<p>The micro:bit lessons is another signature programme that allow students
to develop logical thinking and design skills. Students are provided the
opportunities to apply these skills in Interdisciplinary Project Work (<em>IPW</em>)
and Applied Learning Programme (ALP).</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary coding programme not only equips the students with
an important digital competency skill, it also lays the foundation for
the aspiring students to offer Computing as an O Level subject in the Upper
Secondary.</p>
