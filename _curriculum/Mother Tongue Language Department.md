<h1>Mother Tongue Language Department</h1>
<p>The Mother Tongue Department seeks to develop students’ proficiency in
their Mother Tongue while going beyond academic mastery to foster its practical
use in everyday life. Through engaging and meaningful learning experiences,
students gain a deeper appreciation of their cultural heritage, values,
and traditions. In doing so, they build greater confidence and cultural
awareness, equipping them to participate thoughtfully and respectfully
in a multicultural society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Subjects offered include G1/G2/G3 Chinese Language, Higher Chinese Language
and G1/G2/G3 Malay Language.</p>
<h4><br>Reading Programme</h4>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to cultivate strong reading habits, carefully
selected materials are provided to engage students in meaningful reading.
Customised reading packages and activities are designed to enrich their
reading experience and promote language development.</p>
<h4>Podcast Programme</h4>
<p>The Podcast Programme provides students with authentic opportunities to
develop their oral communication and listening skills. By creating and
engaging with podcasts, students learn to express themselves more clearly
and confidently.</p>
<h4>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight</h4>
<p>The MTL Fortnight offers students a range of hands-on activities that
deepen their appreciation of culture and heritage. It also provides an
immersive environment for students to actively use their Mother Tongue
in creative and practical ways.</p>
<h4>Intensive Revision Programme</h4>
<p>Targeted at students taking the GCE ‘O’ Level Mother Tongue examination,
the Intensive Revision Programme aims to strengthen their readiness and
language skills through focused revision. Held during the last two weeks
of Term 2, the programme equips students with strategies to perform confidently
in the national examination.</p>
<h4>Festive Celebrations: Spring Festival &amp; Hari Raya</h4>
<p>Students come together to celebrate the rich cultural diversity of our
community through the Spring Festival and Hari Raya celebrations. These
festive occasions provide meaningful opportunities to appreciate traditions,
foster mutual respect, and strengthen bonds across cultures.</p>
