<h1>Humanities Department</h1>
<p>The Humanities curriculum comprises Social Studies, Geography and History.
At SFSS, the Humanities Department is committed to nurturing informed,
empathetic, and responsible global citizens. Grounded in <strong>values education</strong>, <strong>inquiry-based learning</strong>,
and the development of <strong>21st Century Competencies</strong>, our curriculum
aims to cultivate critical and reflective thinkers who can make thoughtful
decisions and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>We believe that Humanities education is not just about acquiring knowledge
of the past or present, but also about developing the skills and values
necessary for active participation in a rapidly changing world. Through
the exploration of issues in Geography, History, and Social Studies, students
learn to examine multiple perspectives, develop a sense of place and identity,
and appreciate the complexities of real-world issues.</p>
<p>Our department adopts the <strong>Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) framework</strong>,
which empowers students to ask meaningful questions, gather and evaluate
evidence, and communicate reasoned conclusions. This approach aligns with
the national direction of fostering future-ready learners equipped with
the competencies to thrive in a globalised, interconnected world.

<h4>Geography unit</h4>
<p>The geographical investigations at Springfield Secondary School provided
students with authentic learning experiences that connected classroom knowledge
to real-world issues. In the Secondary 2 project, students explored how
sustainable and inclusive features in Tampines impact residents. Through
data collection, analysis, and empathy-based reflections, they developed
critical thinking, collaboration skills, and values like environmental
responsibility and inclusion.</p>
<p>In the Secondary 3 project, students examined what draws residents to
Our Tampines Hub. By creating surveys, analysing trends, and reflecting
on town planning, they deepened their sense of place and appreciation for
community development. Both investigations empowered students to become
more thoughtful, informed, and engaged citizens.</p>
<h4>Social Studies Unit</h4>
<p>The Sec 3 SSII project centres on understanding the challenges and opportunities
of Singapore’s ageing population. Guided by the inquiry question, “How
can Singapore respond effectively to the challenges and opportunities of
an ageing population?”, students work in diverse groups to examine demographic
trends, assess existing policies and community support, and propose meaningful
solutions. The project comprises three main components: group research
on ageing-related issues, interviews with stakeholders such as elderly
individuals or caregivers followed by data analysis, and an individual
reflection on their learning and personal development. Through this process,
students strengthen their research, communication, and teamwork skills
while developing greater empathy and awareness of ageing issues in society.</p>

<h4>History Unit</h4>
<p>The Sec 1 Historical Investigation (HI) for 2025 centres on the inquiry
question: <em>"How did migrants contribute to the development of Singapore as a port city from 1824 to 1942?"</em> Students
investigate this by selecting a street named after a migrant and researching
that individual’s background, profession, and contributions to colonial
Singapore. The findings are presented through a creative infographic or
biography.</p>
<p>The project is structured in three stages: (1) <strong>Sparking Curiosity</strong>,
where students explore the story of Naraina Pillai through a video and
classroom discussion; (2) <strong>Gathering and Reasoning with Data</strong>,
where students conduct research individually or in pairs using a provided
package and then produce an infographic with proper citations; and (3) <strong>Reflective Thinking</strong>,
where students answer a short reflection on the values or qualities of
the migrant they studied. This investigation helps students appreciate
the diverse contributions of early migrants and develop historical reasoning,
research, and reflection skills.</p>
