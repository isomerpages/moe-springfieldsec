<h1>Physical Education Department</h1>
<p><strong>At Springfield, we believe that physical education is essential to nurturing our students’ overall well-being and character.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our PE programme goes beyond physical fitness. We aim to instil important
values such as resilience, teamwork, discipline, and respect. We also emphasise
healthy living and eating habits, helping students make informed choices
that support lifelong health. Safety is at the heart of all our activities,
ensuring that students learn, play, and grow in a secure and supportive
environment.</p>
<p>We understand that while knowing the importance of well-being is easy,
truly living it requires guidance, practice, and commitment. At Springfield,
we are dedicated to empowering our students to take meaningful steps toward
healthy, balanced, and values-driven lives. We warmly invite you to join
us on this journey to unlock every student’s full potential.</p>
