<h1>Physical Education Department</h1>
<p><strong>At Springfield, we believe that physical education is essential to nurturing our students’ overall well-being and character.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our PE programme goes beyond physical fitness. We aim to instil important
values such as resilience, teamwork, discipline, and respect. We also emphasise
healthy living and eating habits, helping students make informed choices
that support lifelong health. Safety is at the heart of all our activities,
ensuring that students learn, play, and grow in a secure and supportive
environment.</p>

truly living it requires guidance, practice, and commitment. At Springfield,

skills and strategic thinking through physical activities. Students worked
in teams to overcome various obstacles and complete complex tasks that
required both physical prowess and mental acuity. The challenges included
problem-solving elements, communication exercises, and physical activities
that could only be completed through effective teamwork. This event particularly
highlighted the importance of cooperation, leadership, and mutual support
in achieving common goals.</p>

<h4>Track Challenge</h4>
<p>The objective of the Track Challenge is to encourage students to develop
their physical fitness, resilience, and teamwork through friendly athletic
competition. By participating, students build healthy habits, gain confidence
