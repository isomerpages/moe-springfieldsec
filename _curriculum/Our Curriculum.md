<h1>Our Programmes</h1>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, our <strong>educational philosophy is guided by Positive Education (Pos Ed)</strong> -
an approach that brings together academic learning, character development,
and well-being to help every student flourish both in school and in life.</p>
<h4>Our Pos Ed Approach</h4>
<p>Rooted in the science of Positive Psychology, <strong>Pos Ed emphasises cultivating strengths, resilience, purpose, and meaningful relationships</strong>.
We believe that education is not just about achieving good grades, but
about helping Springfielders become confident, grounded, and compassionate
individuals ready to contribute to the world.</p>
<p>We take a <strong>whole-school, whole-child approach</strong> to Pos Ed.
This means:</p>

<p><strong><u>Springfield’s Approach Towards Pos Ed</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit teaching of key well-being and life skills</strong>,
such as emotional regulation, growth mindset, goal-setting, and gratitude,
through platforms like CCE lessons, form teacher time, and key student
development experiences.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implicit practices embedded into daily routines and culture</strong>,
through inclusive and enabling classroom environments, restorative student
management, relationship-building, and teacher-student interactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of it all, our aim is to empower <strong>every student to realise their greatest potential.</strong>
