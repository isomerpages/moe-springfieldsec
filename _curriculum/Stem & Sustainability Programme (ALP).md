# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Springfield’s distinctive programme that incorporates various areas in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field. Through problem-based learning and authentic experiences in the Science and Food laboratories, we aim to develop our students to innovate and think critically as well as creatively, while gaining a deeper understanding in the subjects. The ALP curriculum consists of real-world projects and learning journeys to provide students the opportunity to apply their knowledge and think beyond the scope of the school.

Our programme caters to students of varying interest levels by allowing a tiered system of experiential learning. Throughout their years in secondary school, students will be exposed to experiences from Tier 1 and Tier 2 minimally (see diagram below).

Our foundation programme for Secondary 1 students centers around personal choices to lead a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle through proper health and nutrition. Students learn the essential skills in maintaining a healthy diet such as reading nutrition labels and swapping out ingredients in recipes to make dishes healthier.

This programme culminates in a milestone project where students design their own healthy recipes and attempt to cook and plate their healthy dishes. Students are also required to create eye-catching posters to market their creations to their fellow peers.

An  overview of the Tier 1 Foundation Programme for Secondary 1:

Our  foundation programme for Secondary 2 offers a more self-directed and independent experience for the students. Students are presented with a real-world scenario of ensuring food security amidst land-scarce Singapore. They are given the opportunity to plant their own vegetables in school,  harvest and cook them as part of our signature ‘Farm-to-Table’ experience held at the end of the school year. 

Similarly, students are tasked with a milestone project where they design a prototype for a vertical farming set-up that can be included in the school with minimal landscape use.

<u>**Opportunities for authentic application of knowledge through Outdoor Learning Experiences**</u>

Students are  given the opportunity to visit industry partners to augment their learning experience as part of the ALP journey. This aims to promote and  encourage healthy and sustainable living among the students, and at the same time create an  awareness of the potential job prospects in these industries.

This year, the Secondary Two students visited three local urban farms that are currently providing sustainable solutions to farming and food security.
