<h1>Academic Support @ SFSS</h1>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, <strong>Academic Support</strong> plays
a vital role in supporting the varied learning needs of our students. It
refers to a wide range of instructional methods, educational engagement
opportunities, and school-based resources aimed at helping students improve
their academic performance. Academic support helps students close learning
gaps, keep up with their peers, meet curriculum expectations, and ultimately,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrive in their educational journey.
<br>
</p>
<p>The Academic Support Framework is designed to meet the diverse needs of
our students by providing targeted assistance to those who require additional
help, while also offering enrichment and advanced learning opportunities
to stretch the potential of high-achieving students. This dual approach
ensures that every learner receives the support or challenge they need
to grow academically and reach their fullest potential.</p>

<p>Through our comprehensive and student-centred academic support approach,
the school is committed to nurture every learner to reach their full academic
potential in a caring and enabling environment.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Special Academic Programmes</strong><br></h4>
<p>In addition to in-school initiatives, the school also leverages valuable
external collaborations to further support students in achieving academic
mastery. One such partnership is with MENDAKI through the MENDAKI Tuition
Scheme (MTS), which is conducted within the school premises. This programme
provides targeted academic assistance to selected students, helping to
bridge learning gaps and reinforce content understanding. Another key initiative
is our signature STAR (Springfielders Taking Active Roles towards Success)
Programmes, a collaboration between the school and partnering schools,
where mentors from these institutions work closely with our students to
guide and support them in their academic journey. These partnerships enrich
the learning experience and provide students with tailored, meaningful
academic support beyond regular classroom instruction.</p>
