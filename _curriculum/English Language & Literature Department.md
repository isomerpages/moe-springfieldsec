#### English Literature
The study of Literature centres on literary response – the negotiation of meaning between readers and texts. This Literary Response Framework represents how teachers will design learning experiences that encourage students to respond to texts in a holistic manner. The Framework is shaped like an eye to emphasise how responding to Literature empowers students to read texts and the world in different ways and with discernment.

The spirit and intent of the reading programme is for Springfielders to keep abreast of the current affairs happening around them. Reading also exposes students to multiple sources of information and in turn learn multiples perspectives that allow them to be critical and discerning readers. 

	Carefully curated articles from various themes suitable for the different levels and streams are put together by the department teachers for student to access readily through the school app, Kaleidoscope. These articles include a word bank quiz and questions for students to reflect on, of which will then be covered in their English Language lessons in class.

<br>

* **English Language Magazines**   
With each magazine dedicated to the different streams, these EL magazines aims to supplement student's learning of the language. Pitched appropriately to the different levels, students will subscribe to 4-issues of the magazines that abides closely with MOE EL Syllabuses.

<br>

* **News Reading Programme - All levels**   
The department believes in providing students opportunities to use the language in real-life applications. The News Reading programme aims to give students the platform for them to showcase their reading and presentation skills. At the same time, it is also to imbue students with the confidence in public speaking as well as the use of good conversational English.
<br>

* **Student Activists  Programme - Sec 3**  
Students will embark on an inquiry based on the topic of choice. Students will then conduct research, gather information and propose ways to improve the situation. Students will then present their findings at a school-level platform. The programme aims to equip students with a sense of civic-mindedness and at the same time, be aware of what is happening with the community.
