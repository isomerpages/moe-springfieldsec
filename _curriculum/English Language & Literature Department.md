<p><strong>Walk in Your Shoes’ Project – Sec 1</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A project that centres around empathy, where students will start off with
the unpacking of Voices at Play (VAPs) - which are MOE CPDD curated materials
- and then will embark collaboratively to unpack what is means to embody
and exemplify the value of empathy, which also happens to be one of Springfield
Secondary School values. The project also utilises the skill of script
writing and role play, where students will showcase their ‘acting skills’
in their bid to learn about how to show empathy towards their peers and
others.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Sensory Imagery – Descriptive Writing Project – Sec 2</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a leaf from Willy Wonka and his whimsical chocolate flavours, students
will learn descriptive vocabulary and persuasive techniques in crafting
a new locally flavoured chocolate that would whet anyone’s taste bud. Students
will first explore the wonders of taste, sight, smell and touch through
a series of sensory discovery of local flavours like pandan and ginger,
before they invent a new chocolate flavour that is worthy of being sold
in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Activists Programme – Sec 3</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will embark on an inquiry based on the topic of choice. Students
will then conduct research, gather information and propose ways to improve
the situation. Students will then present their findings at a school-level
platform. The programme aims to equip students with a sense of civic-mindedness
and at the same time, be aware of what is happening with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><br>Students’ Achievements</h4>
<p><u>The Queen’s Royal Commonwealth Essay Competition</u>
</p>
<p>Each year, aspiring young writers are asked to submit their pieces in
response to a theme. The themes are rooted in Commonwealth values, providing
an interesting introduction to the network and allowing young people to
explore their own connection to the Commonwealth, whilst fostering an empathetic
and open-minded world view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the world’s oldest international schools’ writing competition, it
is commendable that our Springfielders have attained the following as entries
for this competition come from all over the globe.&nbsp;
