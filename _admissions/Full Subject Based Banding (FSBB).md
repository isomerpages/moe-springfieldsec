<h1>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h1>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to Personalized Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>At Springfield, we are committed to nurturing every student's potential
through Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB), FSBB represents our dedication
to providing a more customized and inclusive learning experience that recognizes
and develops each student's unique strengths, interests, and learning needs.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding FSBB</strong>
</p>
<p>FSBB moves away from traditional streaming to offer students greater flexibility
in their educational journey. Under this system, students can take subjects
at different levels based on their individual strengths and interests,
rather than being restricted by stream labels. This approach aims to help
students take greater ownership of their learning, develop a growth mindset,
and build intrinsic motivation for lifelong learning while creating more
opportunities for meaningful interaction with peers of different strengths
and interests.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Form Classes and Common Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the key features of FSBB at our school is the implementation of
mixed form classes, where students learn alongside peers with different
strengths and interests. This arrangement creates an inclusive learning
environment that promotes peer support, collaborative learning, and the
development of empathy and understanding among students. It also helps
broaden social networks and reduce any potential stigmatization.</p>
<p>All students participate in six common curriculum subjects: Art, Design
&amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE), Music, and Physical Education. These subjects provide
valuable opportunities for students to develop practical and creative skills,
build character, and engage in collaborative projects that contribute to
their holistic development.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Subject Levels and Flexibility</strong>
</p>
<p>Under FSBB, students can take subjects at three different levels - G1,
G2, and G3 - depending on their strengths and learning needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For core subjects such as English Language, Mathematics, Science, Mother
Tongue Languages, and Humanities, students take these at levels suited
to their individual strengths. Students who excel in specific subjects
may be offered the opportunity to take them at a more demanding level,
with regular reviews ensuring they are taking subjects at appropriate levels.
We provide comprehensive support and bridging programs for students taking
subjects at more demanding levels.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Future Pathways</strong>
</p>
<p>From 2027, students will receive the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education
Certificate (SEC) upon completion of their secondary education. This certificate
will reflect the subjects and levels taken by each student, with grades
earned at different levels recognized for post-secondary admission. FSBB
opens up various post-secondary opportunities including Junior Colleges,
Millennia Institute, Polytechnics, and the Institute of Technical Education,
with specific admission criteria applying for each pathway.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Your Child's Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in strong partnership with parents to support students in their
FSBB journey. Parents are encouraged to understand their child's learning
preferences and interests, support informed decision-making about subject
levels, and maintain regular communication with teachers. We provide comprehensive
support through regular academic counseling, education and career guidance,
learning support programs, and social-emotional support initiatives.</p>
<p>When considering subject levels, our experienced team looks at multiple
factors including the student's aptitude and interest in the subject, current
academic performance, learning attitudes and habits, long-term educational
goals, and overall academic load. This ensures that each student's learning
journey is appropriately customized to their needs and aspirations.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>School Support and Resources</strong>
</p>
<p>Our dedicated team of educators, including Form Teachers, Subject Teachers,
Year Heads, Education and Career Guidance Counselors, and School Counselors,
work together to support students in their FSBB journey. We maintain regular
communication with parents through Parent-Teacher Meetings, progress reports,
and updates via Parents Gateway.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong>
</p>
<p>At Springfield, we are confident that FSBB will enable our students to
discover their strengths, develop their potential, and prepare for future
success. Through this customized approach to learning, we aim to nurture
confident, capable, and well-rounded individuals ready to meet the challenges
of tomorrow.</p>
