<h1>Secondary 1 Posting 2026 Appeal Application (Non-Medical Reason)</h1>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>For students who have just received their secondary school posting in
2025, they may appeal for transfer to Springfield Secondary School by submitting
the appeal application form.</p>
<p>For appeal to be considered, the student's PSLE score should meet the
school's cut-off point of the posting year.</p>

<p>*The last student posted to the school had a PSLE Score better than 30.
However, as the school still had vacancies after S1 posting, its cut-off
point is reflected as 30 as it could have admitted a S1-eligible student
with PSLE score of 30.</p>
