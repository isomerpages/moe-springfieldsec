<h1>Secondary 1 Posting 2026 Appeal Application (Non-Medical Reason)</h1>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>For students who have just received their secondary school posting in
2025, they may appeal for transfer to Springfield Secondary School by submitting
the appeal application form.</p>
<p>For appeal to be considered, the student's PSLE score should meet the
school's cut-off point of the posting year.</p>

<p>*The last student posted to the school had a PSLE Score better than this
score. However, as the school still had vacancies after S1 posting, its
cut-off point is reflected as this score as it could have admitted a S1-eligible
student with PSLE score of this score.</p>
<p>Please note that transfer will be subject to available vacancies and the
school’s admission criteria.&nbsp;</p>
