<h1>Sec 1 Posting 2026</h1>
<p>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Springfield Secondary School! We would like to take
the opportunity to congratulate your child/ ward on reaching another milestone
in their life as they progress from primary to secondary school.</p>
<p>The information shared here will help you to better prepare your child/
ward for his/ her transition to Secondary One. We will also be using Parents
Gateway as a communication platform with parents, and strongly encourage
parents to register for an account if you do not have one yet. (Instructions
on registering for Parents Gateway can be found at <a href="https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/parents-gateway/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/parents-gateway/</a>.)</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering you in the holistic development of your
child/ ward.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The school will use the School Website and Parents Gateway (PG) to share
information for the incoming Secondary One cohort with parents/ guardians.
(For parents/ guardians who do not have access to PG yet, we will be contacting

</li>
</ul>
<h4>F. Start-it-Right (SIR) Programme 2026</h4>
<p><u>Start-it-Right (SIR) Activities from 2nd to 7th Jan 2026</u>
</p>
<p>The SIR is a unique programme designed and customised by the school to
provide a holistic and purposeful transition for the Secondary One students
to secondary school. The students will undergo a series of hands-on, team-based,
and interactive activities to build positive bonds, develop good habits
&amp; routines and strengthen their personal competencies. The students
also work closely with the Class Form Teachers to forge class identity
and establish positive peer relationships, through class and cohort engagement.</p>
<p>There will be a <strong>Parents Briefing on 7th January (Wednesday), 4.00pm to 6.45pm in the school hall </strong>for
parents to learn more about the school’s programmes and processes, including
information on Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) and Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP). You will also get a chance to meet with your
child’s/ ward’s Form Teachers. We would also like to invite parents to
stay on after the briefing to join us in our campfire to celebrate the
rounding up of SIR with your child/ ward and also watch a special performance
that they will be putting up as a class. In view of the late dismissal
on 7 Jan (Wed), your child/ward would be allowed to report to school by
8.00 a.m. the following day, 8 Jan (Thu).</p>
<p>Detailed information on the SIR activities that your child/ ward will
be going through will be sent to parents/ guardians via Parents gateway
(PG).</p>
<p><u>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Orientation</u>
</p>
<p>CCA plays an integral role in the holistic growth and character development
of each student. It also serves as a platform for skills acquisition and
nurturing of talents. <strong>In secondary school, it is compulsory for all students to enrol and participate in a CCA.</strong> Through
CCA, students will be able to develop and contribute actively in key aspects
of student leadership, school representation and community-based service
learning activities. The CCA orientation will provide an overview of the
CCA programme in Springfield and enable the students to find out more about
the different CCAs in the school, and indicate their CCAs choices according
to their interests and talents.</p>
