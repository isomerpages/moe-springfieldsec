**1\. Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise**

The DSA-SEC Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004 to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school. Under this DSA-Sec Exercise, participating schools will be able to select Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released.

**2\. School Vision**

Springfield's school vision is "**_Lifelong Learners, Exemplary Leaders_**". In Springfield, we believe in providing our students with opportunities to develop their sporting talent and leadership, along with school representation. Our DSA talent areas of Rockwall climbing, Floorball and Taekwondo provide the platforms for our students to achieve these.

**(a)&nbsp;Rockwall Climbing**  

The Springfield rock wall is an outstanding Tampines landmark that has captured the attention of many passing by. Built in 1995, it was one of the first outdoor rockwalls in a secondary school. Over the years, thousands of our students have learnt the basics of rockwall climbing through our Physical Education (PE) Programme, and many have excelled in the sport. Our climbers have always been recognized as the rugged and robust students in the school. Rockwall climbing develop mental strength and inculcate qualities such as integrity, resilience, and perseverance. 

  

Secondary 1/2 pupils will be equipped with the basic knowledge, skills, and confidence in rockwall climbing; climbing, rope ascending and abseiling&nbsp;during&nbsp;**Lower Secondary Physical Education (PE) Programme**. They will be able to appreciate the rigours of the sport and also the intrinsic value of climbing. Given the opportunity to participate, pupils can be engaged in self-discovery and cultivation of values. Secondary 2 pupils will be given the opportunity to attain the Singapore National Climbing Standard Rockwall Climbing Certification Level I.

  

**(b) Floorball**

  

This sport was introduced in 2007 in part due to the potential talent of Springfield students. Along with the passion and technical expertise of the teachers, the School was able to achieve significant results. The team is now known for their all-round skills, teamwork, and resilience. Students are also given opportunities to organize our very own inter-school floorball competition annually.

Inter-school / organized competitions play a vital part in the long-term excellence and sustainability of the floorball. A key feature is&nbsp;**Springfield Blast!**&nbsp;\- an annual inter-school floorball competition organized by Springfield. Students are given leadership opportunities during the organization of this competition. This will be a platform for talent development and maturity, helping them in their holistic development.


**(c) Taekwondo**

With the official introduction of Taekwondo in the National School Games in 2009, Springfield Taekwondo was provided with greater scope for involvement and achievements. Participating students are given various participation opportunities ranging from team display to sparring categories. Grading assessment is integrated into the CCA to promote rigour and professionalism. Various aesthetics based activities like taekwondo aerobics is also added to enhance the overall participation in the sport.

The TKD&nbsp;**CCA programme**&nbsp;will support and reinforce the interest and ability of pupils. There will be various competitions, training camps, community involvement projects and leadership training for pupils. The TKD CCA programme will serve to bring about strong values and the desired outcomes of education in our students.
