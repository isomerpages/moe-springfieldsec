##### **Reflections from Our Students**
![](/images/javier.jpg)

I used to be in Wushu in Primary School but had confidence issues so I dropped out of the CCA. However, the past experiences with Martial Arts gave me an advantage in terms of flexibility.
<br>In SFSS Taekwondo, I was completely new to the sport and did not achieve much in Sec 1, but through my peers and seniors, I had gained more confidence and started to work harder in Taekwondo, resulting in me improving tremendously.
<br>I was offered a CCA Leader Role in Sec 2 which inspired me to achieve more. I then ran for CCA Captainship in Sec 3 with the encouragement from my Seniors and Teachers, and managed to win the honour of taking on the role of Captain of the CCA.
<br>I had attained silver and bronze medals in Sec 1 and after putting in more effort to train and improve, I consistently won gold medals every year after.
<br>Taekwondo boosted my confidence throughout the 4 years; I started with a White belt in Sec 1 and progressed to a Red Belt in Sec 4, and had become more disciplined, resilient and confident.

**2\. School Vision**

Springfield's school vision is "**_Lifelong Learners, Exemplary Leaders_**". In Springfield, we believe in providing our students with opportunities to develop their sporting talent and leadership, along with school representation. Our DSA talent areas of Rockwall climbing, Floorball and Taekwondo provide the platforms for our students to achieve these.

**(a)&nbsp;Rockwall Climbing**  

The Springfield rock wall is an outstanding Tampines landmark that has captured the attention of many passing by. Built in 1995, it was one of the first outdoor rockwalls in a secondary school. Over the years, thousands of our students have learnt the basics of rockwall climbing through our **Physical Education (PE) Programme**, and many have excelled in the sport. Our climbers have always been recognized as the rugged and robust students in the school. Rockwall climbing develop mental strength and inculcate qualities such as integrity, resilience, and perseverance. 

  

In Springfield’s PE Programme, Lower Secondary students are equipped with the basic knowledge, skills, and confidence in rockwall climbing; climbing, rope ascending and abseiling. They will learn to appreciate the rigour of the sport and the intrinsic value of climbing. With the opportunity to participate, students can be engaged in self-discovery and cultivation of values. Secondary 2 students will also be given the opportunity to attain the Singapore National Climbing Standard Rockwall Climbing Certification Level I.

  

**(b) Floorball**

  

This sport was introduced in Springfield in 2007 as many Springfielders had displayed talent and interest. With the passion and support from the teachers, the School was able to achieve significant results. The team is now known for their all-round skills, teamwork, and resilience. 

Participation in competitions such as the National School Games play a vital role in providing our students with opportunities to develop their technical skillsets and qualities such as leadership, teamwork and resilience. At Springfield, our floorball students also organize **Springfield Blast!**, - our very own an annual inter-school floorball competition. Through this platform, students develop other competencies such as organizational skills, and different aspects of leadership skills and teamwork, that complement the skills that they need in the court. Such holistic development grooms our students to be well-rounded individuals who are grounded in values. 

**(c) Taekwondo**

Springfield’s Taekwondo (TKD) Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programme supports and reinforces the interests and abilities of students. Students are involved in various competitions, training camps, community involvement projects and leadership training. Grading assessment is also integrated into the CCA to promote rigour and professionalism. Aesthetics-based activities like Taekwondo Aerobics is included in the programme to provide students with exposure to a greater range of experiences and activities as well. The TKD CCA programme serves to inculcat values and imbue in students the desired outcomes of education.

With the introduction of Taekwondo in the National School Games in 2009, Springfield Taekwondo was provided with greater scope for involvement and achievements. Participating students are given participation opportunities that range from team display to sparring categories. Participation in competitions help students to develop mental strength, focus and resilience.
