<h1>Our Partners</h1>
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<p>The SFSS Partnership Framework aims to foster <strong>strategic, supportive, and sustainable</strong> partnerships
with key stakeholders to provide well-rounded educational opportunities
and support for students’ success, aligned with the school’s vision and
mission. In its collaborations, the school adopts the following guiding
principles: <strong>strategic alignment</strong> (ensuring partnerships are
purposeful and impactful in achieving long-term goals), <strong>supportiveness</strong> (designing
programmes that are tailored to meet the needs of both teachers and students),
and <strong>sustainability</strong> (creating lasting relationships that
contribute to continuous growth and development).</p>
<p>The school selects partners based on their ability to offer academic support,
enhance student experiences, and promote students’ well-being. Furthermore,
the school believes that for partnerships to be sustained and truly effective,
they must be built on <strong>care, respect, trust, open communication</strong>,
and <strong>shared responsibilities</strong>, ensuring that all parties
are invested in the long-term success of the partnership.</p>

<h4><strong>PARTNERSHIP LEVELS – CONNECT, ENGAGE, TRANSFORM (CET)</strong></h4>
<p>The Partnership Levels, <strong>Connect, Engage, Transform (CET),</strong> describes
the possible levels of partnership that can be established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Connect:&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the Connect level, stakeholders and/or external partners lend their
support for school programmes and initiatives. We value the diverse expertise
that our stakeholders and partners can bring to augment the development
of our students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Engage:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the Engage level, the school and stakeholders and/or external partners
collaborate to develop, plan and implement projects or programmes. This
deeper level of partnership can help us to enhance our programmes and initiatives
to achieve better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Transform:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the Transform phase, stakeholders and/or external partners take the
lead in the planning and implementation of projects and programmes. The
specialised expertise of these stakeholders and/ or partners could be beyond
what our teachers are trained in.</p>
