<p>Following the success of the Alumni Homecoming, we held an Alumni Evening
Tea Session on 17 July 2025. Understanding the busy schedules of our alumni,
these meetings are usually held in the evening and will follow a hybrid
format (both online and physical sessions) to accommodate those who cannot
attend in person.</p>
<p><u>Objectives of Alumni Evening Tea Sessions:</u>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engage interested alumni to share their ideas and aspirations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify potential candidates for the formation of the Springfield Alumni
Association.</p>
</li>
