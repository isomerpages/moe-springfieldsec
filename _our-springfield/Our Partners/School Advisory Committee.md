# **School Advisory Committee**

![](/images/SACupdateMay2024.png)

Our School Advisory Committee was founded in 1993. Springfield recognises that on our own, the school faces limitations in bringing out the best in our pupils. We need the support of a wide network of stakeholders, people with whom we can work in tandem to offer our pupils the best in their aim to achieve educational excellence. Springfield, therefore, reaches out to the School Advisory Committee to work together in service of our pupils.
