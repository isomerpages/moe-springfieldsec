<h1><strong>School Advisory Committee</strong></h1>
<p>Our School Advisory Committee was founded in 1993.</p>
<p>At Springfield, we believe in an “all-hands-on-deck” approach to supporting
our students, and our School Advisory Committee is a key stakeholder who
plays a big part. Their support for the school and students has been and
continues to be invaluable, as they bring with them far-reaching networks,
industry expertise, financial support and a big heart to help our students
grow and progress.</p>
<p>Our Springfield School Advisory Committee members are as found below.
If you are interested in joining the committee and playing a part in the
growth journey of our students, please contact us at <a href="mailto:springfields@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">springfields@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
