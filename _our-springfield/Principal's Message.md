# **Principal's Message**

Dear members of the Springfield community,

It is my honor to welcome all new students and staff to Springfield, and to welcome everyone else back to school for the new academic year!

Despite having just joined the school, I have experienced a warm welcome from the Springfield community – students, staff, parents, Alumni and the School Advisory Committee. I am excited to connect further with the different stakeholder groups to hear perspectives, understand needs and work together towards desired goals. United, we can make a positive difference and help our students reach their full potential.

In taking over the school, I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank Mrs Mabel Leong, and the various Principals before her, for developing Springfield to what it is today. 30 years ago, the name “Springfield” was chosen to represent flexibility and resilience, as well as growth and development. Indeed, grow and develop with flexibility and resilience was what we did. Last year, Springfield celebrated its 30th School Anniversary, and there are many achievements that we can be proud of. Our Springfielders have done us proud in academics, co-curricular activities (Sports, Performing Arts and Uniformed Groups) and most importantly, in character and life skills development. We will continue to develop our students as **Lifelong Learners** and **Exemplary Leaders**, who are grounded in our **GR2ID school values of Graciousness, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Diligence**. By standing on the shoulders of giants, I have gained a vantage point, and hope to continue the good work to build upon what has been established.      

With the COVID-19 situation an endemic one, many of the school’s activities may resume to “pre-Covid” norms. This presents more opportunities for students and stakeholders to pursue their passions and interests, connect face-to-face, and benefit from the “human touch” or experiential learning. However, COVID-19 has also opened our eyes to the affordances of technology, which we will continue to harness where beneficial. We will continue to enhance our students’ engagement and learning via the National Digital Literacy Programme, where all students will own a personalised learning device, and develop self-directed learning with home-based learning. 

With the world rapidly changing, we live in challenging times. We need to prepare our charges to be adaptable and resilient, to be able to respect differences and embrace diversity, to be discerning yet build trusting relationships. Every individual has the power to change the world for the better, starting with ourselves. Hence, I call out to all Springfielders, students and staff alike, to join me in living out our school motto of **‘Better Self for Better Tomorrow’**. 

Wishing all a healthy and fulfilling 2023.
