# **Our School Song**
*Music by Soh Kay Cheng   
Lyrics by Rosa Lein*

Springfield, oh Springfield,   
To you our loyalty we pledge,   
With glory your flag we raise.   
In one resounding voice    
We sing your praise    
Diligent in our work,      
Your worth we proclaim.    
Springfield, our Springfield     
In truth and virtue we grow,     
For Better Self and Better Tomorrow.

Springfield, oh Springfield,   
We strive to live up to your name,    
To bring you glory and fame.    
From the glowing earth   
Rises the golden sun,   
Brightly lights the way    
Till our work is done     
Springfield, dear Springfield,   
We hear your beckoning call   
Better Self for Better Tomorrow.
