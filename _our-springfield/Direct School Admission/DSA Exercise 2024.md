##### **Reflections from Our Students**
![](/images/javier.jpg)

I used to be in Wushu in Primary School but had confidence issues so I dropped out of the CCA. However, the past experiences with Martial Arts gave me an advantage in terms of flexibility.<br>
<br>In SFSS Taekwondo, I was completely new to the sport and did not achieve much in Sec 1, but through my peers and seniors, I had gained more confidence and started to work harder in Taekwondo, resulting in me improving tremendously.<br>
<br>I was offered a CCA Leader Role in Sec 2 which inspired me to achieve more. I then ran for CCA Captainship in Sec 3 with the encouragement from my Seniors and Teachers, and managed to win the honour of taking on the role of Captain of the CCA.<br>
<br>I had attained silver and bronze medals in Sec 1 and after putting in more effort to train and improve, I consistently won gold medals every year after.
<br>Taekwondo boosted my confidence throughout the 4 years; I started with a White belt in Sec 1 and progressed to a Red Belt in Sec 4, and had become more disciplined, resilient and confident.

Unlike most others, I was home-schooled up till PSLE growing up. Naturally, I was more reserved and soft-spoken than most of my peers and struggled with speaking in front of a group of people initially.

In my time in Outdoor Pursuits Club (OPC), I was tried again and again, both physically and mentally. I was given many leadership opportunities such as being appointed as the Overall-In-Charge for a day in our Annual Let’s Rock Competition in Secondary 2 and the Climbing Master in the CCA for my Upper Secondary days. Through these experiences, I quickly built confidence and was eventually able to clearly delegate roles to my Juniors. <br>
<br>Rock Climbing has also made me one with greater mental tenacity and determination since in training, we fail more than we succeed. I’ve also learnt to deal with failures and setbacks as each time I fall, I have to pick myself up, reorganize my thoughts and give it another good go with the aim of coming back stronger. To me, winning is not all that important. More often than not, progress is more triumphant. <br>
<br>All these takeaways that I got from my time in OPC translated to my academics where self-discipline, resilience and determination were of great importance

Back in primary school, I was really a rebellious child, always getting into unnecessary trouble with the other kids in school. Back at home, I would not listen to my parents and always disobeyed them. I started to change for the better when I was in secondary school due to my CCA, Outdoor Pursuits Club (OPC). I started taking up leadership roles to guide my other fellow classmates/ teammates. It was also at OPC that I fell in love with Rockwall Climbing. <br>
<br>There, I learnt to be disciplined and focused. Why discipline and focus? Simply because it has kept me on track with what I have planned for myself. Success doesn’t come easy. So knowing that I have that clear goal and sticking to the plan has helped me stay the path when representing Springfield and finally, Singapore. <br>
<br>Besides that, I also learnt to believe in the process and myself. If you’re going to have doubts in yourself, you wouldn’t break new barriers. I am thankful to those who have helped me along the way. I always have them at the back of my head even though I don’t tell them how much I’ve appreciated their support and guidance! Without the values and lessons I’ve learnt until now, I wouldn’t become who I am today. Someone who ensures that he sticks to a plan or goal and does not get distracted by anyone or anything.

Floorball has been my hobby since Primary 3. The fast-paced game encourages me to make decisions quickly and practice communication among my teammates in court. I was elected the Vice-Captain and did my best to lead by example. I am thankful for my Teachers-In-Charge, my Coach, and especially my Teammates for being a part of my Springfield floorball journey.  <br>My passion for Floorball has yet to fade. When I was an Nanyang Polytechnic pursuing a Diploma in Sport and Wellness Management, I continued to pursue my passion in Floorball by playing for U Sports Portege FC and for the Polytechnic. Certainly, the four years playing floorball has helped me in becoming someone who is more resilient to challenges, confident to stand out, and disciplined to juggle various responsibilities.

I found out about floorball during my primary school time. Floorball was not a popular choice back then, but I still wanted to join as I wanted to follow the footsteps of my brother. I went for the trials and ironically to me, the sport was fun and intense. I loved how fast paced and intense the game is. It really caught my eye.

After the trials, a strong passion for floorball started to develop within me as I knew that this was something that I liked. I was then selected to represent my primary school. When it was my time to graduate from my primary school, I lost passion in floorball due to the pandemic and a year of not being able to play. I joined Springfield Secondary School after discovering the school has floorball as a CCA. When I was offered to lead their floorball boys' team in Secondary Two, I straight away took up the chance.

Throughout my journey in both primary and secondary school, floorball has been instrumental in shaping my character. It instilled in me the values of leadership, resilience, and teamwork, proving that with dedication and effort, one can surpass expectations. Despite the obstacles that may arise, I remain committed to continuing my floorball journey with my secondary school team.
