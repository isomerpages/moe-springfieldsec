# **Home School Partnership**

Dear Parents / Guardians,

Springfield Secondary School is committed to build a positive partnership with parents in order to develop our students as <b>Lifelong Learners and Exemplary Leaders</b>, who are grounded in our <b>GR2ID school values of Graciousness, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Diligence</b>. We need to prepare them to be adaptable and resilient, to be able to respect differences and embrace diversity; in so doing, let us work together to live out our school motto of <b>‘Better Self for Better Tomorrow’</b>.

In order to have better home-school partnership, we hope the following guidelines provide greater clarity on how we can work hand-in-hand to help our students have ownership over their learning, develop a sense of purpose and success in life.  
 
 
1. To instill <b>personal responsibility and independence</b> in our students, teachers will communicate <b>directly</b> with them on matters pertaining to schoolwork/ CCA, e.g., homework to be done, materials to be brought to school etc. We encourage parents to check in with your child/ ward on these and have them seek assistance <b>directly </b> from teachers if necessary.  
<br>
2.	Parents will be kept informed of school events and student attendance, HBL days etc. via notices sent out through <b>Parents Gateway (PG)</b>. Teachers may also contact you to discuss support for or well-being of your child/ward. If there is a need, parents may use the following channels to reach teachers: 
<br>•	School General Office: 6318 3053
<br>•	School Email: springfields@moe.edu.sg
<br>•	Specific Teacher’s Email that can be found at: https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/our-organisation/

Teachers will generally be contactable during the timings stipulated below:


You may also check with your child’s/ward’s teacher on the best way to contact him/her.
