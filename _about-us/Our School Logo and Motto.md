# **Our School Logo and Motto**

     style="width:25%">

  
The blade of green grass forms the letter "**S**".  
The glowing sun, together with the green grass, forms the letter "**f**".   
The three rows of rich, golden earth provide the foundation.    
Together they represent Springfield Secondary School.    
The grass is also shaped to represent a hand.     
Symbolically, it portrays the tender care by which the school nurtures pupils to becomeÂ wholesome adults.

  

### Our Motto 

"Better Self for Better Tomorrow"
