### Department Programmes:

**Mother Tongue Fortnight Week (Language & Culture Week)**

The theme for this year is ‘Jejak Warisan’ (Heritage Trail). There will be hands-on activities, and mini competitions to deepen students’ understanding and appreciation towards Malay language, culture, and heritage.

**Reading Programme**

In our continuous effort to inculcate good reading habits amongst students, selected reading materials suitable for our age readers are compiled and presented in a booklet. Good reading skills are also reinforced among our young readers. This is done through a special column allocated in every reading page to encourage reflective reading. Students can pen their thoughts as they read.

  

All students are involved in the programme which takes place from Term 1 onwards.

All students will be embarking on this programme this year. The programme aims to further support students’ understanding towards Malay idioms (peribahasa). Through this programme, students will have the opportunity to hone their creativity through planning and creating interesting reading materials.

**Mother Tongue Intensive Programme**
