### Department Goals/Objectives:

*   To develop scientific mindsets, inquiry and practical knowledge of science and its applications to prepare students for a fast-changing and globalised world of the 21st century.
*   To impart excitement and value of Science to students.


### Department Programmes:

#### Empowering Springfielders to Learn for Life to be Future Leaders

##### 1) Science Research Programme #####

The Science Research Programme is offered to selected Secondary 1 to 3 students who have demonstrated interest in and aptitude for scientific research. It provides the opportunity for these students to participate actively in research projects independently and responsibly, under the guidance of the Science Research Mentors. 

The programme aims to promote an appreciation of the methods, culture and ethos of research through immersion of scientific inquiry and innovation. The research teams will thereon communicate their research findings at various Science Research competitions.

##### 2) Secondary 1 Science and Mathematics Escape Room #####

The Science and Mathematics Escape Room is a collaborative effort of the two departments to promote applied learning of scientific and mathematical concepts amongst the Secondary 1 students.

Using the knowledge and skills acquired from their Science and Mathematics lessons, students applied their learning to solve integrated Science and Mathematics tasks of varying difficulties. Each task solved will unlock a clue for students to unravel the mystery of the “ZOMBI-22 virus” and find the identity of “Patient Zero” to escape from the laboratory within the shortest time possible. 

The Science and Mathematics Escape Room programme aims to engage the students by making the learning of the Sciences and Mathematics fun, exciting and meaningful. The activities and tasks that the students participated in help develop critical thinking skills and problem solving skills that are key in today's world. This programme is also one of our school's unique approaches towards formative assessments and applied learning in both Science and Mathematics.

##### 3) Secondary 2 STEM Fiesta #####

The STEM Fiesta is a specially curated programme to engage and ignite the interest and passion of our Secondary 2 students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). This Fiesta provides opportunities for students to explore the wonders of STEM, through exciting and engaging activities that enable them to apply scientific knowledge in the areas of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS).

At the Biology station, students applied concepts of the ecosystem to build a terrarium. At the Chemistry station, students investigated how changes in pH denatures milk protein and turns milk into solid casein. At the Physics station, students explored the concepts of gravitational potential energy while creating their own paper roller coaster. At the Nutrition and Food Science station, students designed and made their unique 3D jelly cake at the school kitchen. The STEM Fiesta has provided our students a platform to appreciate STEM and experience the joy of learning

##### 4) Secondary 3 Kite Programme #####

Springfield has made inroads into interdisciplinary approaches in learning. The Science and Mathematics departments have combined their efforts in ensuring that students are able to have a holistic view of their subjects.

Kite-making and kite-flying during post-exam was an activity where students explored the Mathematical concepts of quadrilaterals and Physics concepts of the different forces that act on the kite which allows it to ascend: tension, thrust, drag, lift and gravity.

### **Biodiversity Learning Journey**

Secondary 2 students were engaged in an outdoor learning experience in Ecology at different locations in Singapore last year. They had the opportunity to explore the rich biodiversity of the flora and fauna of Singapore and learn about the conservation efforts and strategies that aim at conserving Singapore's habitats and ecosystems for long-term sustainability. While some classes went on a learning trail at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, other classes went to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.

During the learning journey at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, students were able to experience and interact with nature and learn about the variety of plant, animal and insect life in one of Singapore's richest and most diverse ecological systems. At the same time, students also learnt about the importance of conserving our natural heritage and developed a sense of commitment and ownership of the reserve. 

At the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, students explored the biodiversity gallery, tracing the history of life on Earth, learnt about the evolution history of terrestrial vertebrates and studied closely the diplodocid sauropod skeletons. Explorations of the gallery aroused the students' curiosity and interest in the rich natural history and heritage of Singapore and had a better appreciation and understanding of the conservation efforts in Singapore.

The learning trail through the wetlands of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore's first ASEAN Heritage Park, enabled students to explore and discover the rich biodiversity of the extensive mangrove forest of the reserve. Trekking through the trails of the reserve, students discovered the native inhabitants of the reserve such as the mudskippers, crabs, monitor lizards and otters, and learnt about the resident birds such as the herons, the kingfishers and sunbirds.

### **SFSS Junior MasterChef Challenge**

Started as an American cooking game show involving kids from ages nine to twelve years old, the Junior MasterChef has caught on in several other countries. Springfield Secondary School had also launched in 2019 its very own SFSS Junior MasterChef Challenge involving Secondary 1 students, with the theme 'Festive Cookies'. The challenge aimed at getting students to apply what they had learnt in their FCE lessons and display their baking skills and creativity by preparing and plating their baked goodies based on the requirements of the challenge. The challenge also aims to promote interest in the culinary art and food sciences.

Secondary 1 students were provided with some training during their FCE practical lessons to learn and acquire certain culinary skills. In the preliminary round, the best two pairs of students from each class were shortlisted and went on to compete in the final round. Prior to the challenge, the contestants attended a Baking Masterclass to refine and hone further their skills at baking and icing cookies. The winners of the challenge were voted for by their peers and a panel of judges.
