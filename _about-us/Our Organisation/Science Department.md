### Department Goals/Objectives:

*   To ignite students' curiosity, passion and joy of learning the Sciences.
*   To stimulate interest in and care for the local and global environment.
*   To equip students with scientific mind-sets, values and practical knowledge of science and its applications to prepare them for Life and Society.  

### Department Programmes:

#### Science & Food Science Research Programme (SFSRP)

The Science and Food Science Research Programme (SFSRP) is offered to selected Secondary 3 students who have demonstrated interest in and aptitude for scientific research. It provides the opportunity for these Students to participate actively in research projects independently and responsibly, under the guidance of the Science and NFS Research Mentors. The programme aims to promote an early appreciation of the methods, culture and ethos of research through immersion of scientific inquiry. The research teams will thereon communicate their research findings at various Science Research Competitions.

### **2019 East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair  

**Achievement: Merit Award**

On 30th July 2019, 3 students from Secondary 3 Fortitude took part in the annual East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair 2019, organized by the East Zone Science and Technology Centre at Victoria Junior College and sponsored by A\*STAR. This is part of the school's effort in inspiring and generating greater interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics among our Students. Kristal Koo Ting Yean, Qistina Nadhirah and Shermaine Lau Tsz Kei conducted an investigative science project on the effectiveness of Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) and the amount of time required for effective pathogen inactivation. The team spent months carrying out various experiments using recycled PET bottles brought back from their Global Education Programme in Siem Reap, Cambodia. On Judging Day, the team impressed the panel with their creativity, experimental design and teamwork and clinched the Merit Award. Through this project, the team found the overall experience invaluable as it helped to instill in them the confidence to pursue research work at the tertiary level and to further develop their interest in the sciences.
