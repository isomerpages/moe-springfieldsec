### Department Goals/Objectives:

*   To develop scientific mindsets, inquiry and practical knowledge of science and its applications to prepare students for a fast-changing and globalised world of the 21st century.
*   To impart excitement and value of Science to students.


### Department Programmes:

#### Empowering Springfielders to Learn for Life to be Future Leaders

##### 1) Science Research Programme #####

The Science Research Programme is offered to selected Secondary 1 to 3 students who have demonstrated interest in and aptitude for scientific research. It provides the opportunity for these students to participate actively in research projects independently and responsibly, under the guidance of the Science Research Mentors. 

The programme aims to promote an appreciation of the methods, culture and ethos of research through immersion of scientific inquiry and innovation. The research teams will thereon communicate their research findings at various Science Research competitions.

##### 2) Secondary 1 Science and Mathematics Escape Room #####

The Science and Mathematics Escape Room is a collaborative effort of the two departments to promote applied learning of scientific and mathematical concepts amongst the Secondary 1 students.

Using the knowledge and skills acquired from their Science and Mathematics lessons, students applied their learning to solve integrated Science and Mathematics tasks of varying difficulties. Each task solved will unlock a clue for students to unravel the mystery of the “ZOMBI-22 virus” and find the identity of “Patient Zero” to escape from the laboratory within the shortest time possible. 

The Science and Mathematics Escape Room programme aims to engage the students by making the learning of the Sciences and Mathematics fun, exciting and meaningful. The activities and tasks that the students participated in help develop critical thinking skills and problem solving skills that are key in today's world. This programme is also one of our school's unique approaches towards formative assessments and applied learning in both Science and Mathematics.

##### 3) Secondary 2 STEM Fiesta #####

The STEM Fiesta is a specially curated programme to engage and ignite the interest and passion of our Secondary 2 students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). This Fiesta provides opportunities for students to explore the wonders of STEM, through exciting and engaging activities that enable them to apply scientific knowledge in the areas of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS).

At the Biology station, students applied concepts of the ecosystem to build a terrarium. At the Chemistry station, students investigated how changes in pH denatures milk protein and turns milk into solid casein. At the Physics station, students explored the concepts of gravitational potential energy while creating their own paper roller coaster. At the Nutrition and Food Science station, students designed and made their unique 3D jelly cake at the school kitchen. The STEM Fiesta has provided our students a platform to appreciate STEM and experience the joy of learning

##### 4) Secondary 3 Kite Programme #####

Springfield has made inroads into interdisciplinary approaches in learning. The Science and Mathematics departments have combined their efforts in ensuring that students are able to have a holistic view of their subjects.

Kite-making and kite-flying during post-exam was an activity where students explored the Mathematical concepts of quadrilaterals and Physics concepts of the different forces that act on the kite which allows it to ascend: tension, thrust, drag, lift and gravity.

### **Empowering Staff to Inspire and Aspire**

We strive to engage our diverse learners through novel and experiential activities to spark curiosity in Science. Through facilitating learning in a positive classroom environment, we inspire and motivate our students to apply core ideas, practices and ethos of Science in their daily lives. 

As professional educators, we continuously take on the mindset of life-long learners, engaging in professional development to stay relevant and effective. We also value the sharing of good practices within learning communities and professional networks both locally and internationally. Platforms where our teachers have learned and shared among educators include:

-	Singapore International Science Teachers’ Conference (SISTC)
-	Singapore Learning Designers Circle (SgLDC)
-	Professional Learning Teams (PLT)
-	Department Engagement and Learning Day
