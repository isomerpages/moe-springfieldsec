### Department Goals / Objectives:

Springfield’s Humanities Programme seeks to engage our students in an appreciation of the real world issues that impact their lives. It aims to encourage students to investigate the past, help them make sense of the world they live in, and equip them with the skills to envision the future. In so doing, the programme will not only cultivate critical and creative life-long learners but ultimately young citizens who are active, responsible, socially-aware and possessing a global perspective.

  

### Curriculum:

**Foundational Years (Secondary 1 and 2)**

The first 2 years of the programme are aimed at giving students a broad overview of the world as they know it, both from a spatial as well as a temporal perspective. Through the study of Geography, students will learn about natural and human phenomena and their related issues. At the same time, the study of History will enable them to understand significant periods, communities and characteristics of history. In addition, students would have had a good experience of the demands of both History and Geography, which will enable them to make an informed decision on their subject choice for the Specialisation Years. Whatever the choice, the programme ensures that they will have the necessary foundational content and skills needed for a smooth transition into the Specialisation Years.

**Specialisation Years (Secondary 3, 4 and 5)**

For the later years, in addition to the study of Social Studies, students will choose their preferred area of specialisation and concentrate on working towards their N or O level certification. They will also be provided with in-depth training in the skills of the respective disciplines through the inquiry-based learning and geographical investigation approaches.
