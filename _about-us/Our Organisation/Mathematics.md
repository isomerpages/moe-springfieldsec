#### Making Learning Relevant

***Learning Estimation through Supermarket Experience: Sec 1 (2021)***

Students learnt the concept of estimation through a Supermarket activity. It is authentic, interactive and collaborative which the students find it engaging.

***Kite Design and Flying: Sec 3 (2021)***

An interdisciplinary collaboration with the Science Department, we want the students to learn Mathematics and Science concepts through this activity. The students learnt about the forces acting on the kite and the properties of the shapes used for the kite.

#### Classroom Learning Experience

***Learning with Technology: Sec 1 to 3 (2022)***

<br>Technology provides students with easy-to-access information, accelerated their learning and fun opportunities to practice what they had learnt.

#### Alternative assessments


***Math Trail: Sec 1 (2019)***

The Trail builds confidence in students’ ability to recall and use their knowledge gained from lessons. It also gave them authentic learning experiences through combining students’ understanding, experiences and reasoning.

***Statistics Learning Experience: Sec 2 (2022)***

Statistics is a branch of Mathematics that deals with collection, organization, presentation, computation and interpretation of data. In the Mathematics syllabus, it is important for students to understand and be able to interpret given data. Thus this activity made the learning of Statistics alive.

This is a collaboration with the Mathematics, Design and Technology and ART Department. 

We want to provide the Students with an authentic learning platform where they can learn through research and collaboration, think critically and creatively. 

The Students also learn life skills such as Oral Communication when presenting their ideas and working effectively in teams.

#### **Real World Tasks: Sec 3 (2019)**

The ability to apply Mathematics to real-life contexts is of utmost importance. At Secondary 3 Level, the Teachers come together and crafted out authentic real-world tasks for the Students to apply their Mathematics knowledge.
