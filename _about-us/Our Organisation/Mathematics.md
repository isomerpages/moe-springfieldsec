#### Making Learning Relevant

***Learning Estimation through Supermarket Experience: Sec 1 (2021)***

Students learnt the concept of estimation through a Supermarket activity. It is authentic, interactive and collaborative which the students find it engaging.

***Kite Design and Flying: Sec 3 (2021)***

An interdisciplinary collaboration with the Science Department, we want the students to learn Mathematics and Science concepts through this activity. The students learnt about the forces acting on the kite and the properties of the shapes used for the kite.

#### Classroom Learning Experience

***Learning with Technology: Sec 1 to 3 (2022)***

<br>Technology provides students with easy-to-access information, accelerated their learning and fun opportunities to practice what they had learnt.

#### Alternative assessments


***Math Trail: Sec 1 (2019)***

The Trail builds confidence in students’ ability to recall and use their knowledge gained from lessons. It also gave them authentic learning experiences through combining students’ understanding, experiences and reasoning.

***Statistics Learning Experience: Sec 2 (2022)***

Statistics is a branch of Mathematics that deals with collection, organization, presentation, computation and interpretation of data. In the Mathematics syllabus, it is important for students to understand and be able to interpret given data. Thus this activity made the learning of Statistics alive.

***Inquiry Based Learning: Sec 3 (2022)***

To enhance students’ problem solving skill and enable them to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, the Secondary 3 went through Inquiry Based Learning. The task was to determine whether the motion of the ball can be modelled by quadratic function.

The students learnt to use an app for tracking of motion, plotting the motion on Google Sheet and made their conclusion.

***Mathematics Learning Day: Sec 1 to 3 (2022)***

Students in Springfield Secondary School are engaged in a termly programme by the Mathematics Department: Mathematics Learning Day. In May’s Learning Day @ Springfield, students are equipped with the knowledge and skills as well and the capacities to think logically, critically and analytically with the activities planned out for them. Students will find joy in the learning of Mathematics through Real World Practices.

In each term, students will go through an activity based on the three strands in the Mathematics curriculum:



Numbers and Algebra
Geometry and Measurement
Statistics and Probability


By infusing Numbers and Algebra and the game Sudoku, students and teachers embarked on a journey through a virtual Escape Room.

We have also combined the Mathematics strand on Geometry and Measurement with Football. Through the e-quiz, students go on a school hunt trail to complete the quiz as well as to find out more about the school.

As we part of the Springfield’s 30th PEARL Anniversary events, students get to understand and experienced the situation that happened during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis through the life of Springfield teachers, Ms Tan and Mr Chong through Google Form.

Students also participated actively in the termly Mathematics Learning Day and have shown greater interest and understanding towards Mathematics and the application to Real World Context Practices.
