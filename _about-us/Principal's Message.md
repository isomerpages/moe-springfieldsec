# **Principal's Message**
<img src="/images/Principal.png" style="width:300px;height:400px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

We, the educators of Springfield have begun the new academic year of 2022 with first welcoming our Sec 1 Springfielders and together with our senior Springfielders (Sec 2s, 3s, 4s and 5s) have successfully completed our  **‘Start-It-Right’ (SIR)** programme. 

In Springfield we believe in nurturing **Lifelong Learners** who will eventually be **Exemplary Leaders**. As we embrace all learners regardless of their starting points in their journey of education, we believe in learning from making our 1st mistake and taking the **2nd chance** to get ourselves back on track. All Springfielders do their own reflections together with their classmates and are strongly encouraged to be good team players so that they are imbued with **‘Esprit de Corps’** not only in class but also in their Co-curricular activities.  

Being able to start it right and to learn to not be alone but to enjoy the support and camaraderie of friends, our Springfielders have proven that they get the freedom to choose the road they want to travel, knowing that the teachers and allied educators are present to lend them a helping hand whenever they need it.

All this will culminate with our Springfielders preparing themselves for their milestone test of readiness to graduate from secondary education and progress on to post-secondary pursuits – Junior College / Polytechnic / ITE vocational training.  

Here, I am pleased to share that our cohort 2021 have all successfully completed their secondary education and all have found different pathways to build their future.

I am very proud of all of our graduates for despite having different abilities and capacities in learning, all are well prepared and ready to take the challenge and have proven that if they believe in themselves, they will achieve together.

Thus, I hope that all parents and Springfielders who have read this message will join me to cheer our current Springfielders on. Give them your best support and encouragement so that they too will have the full confidence to ride the waves that are still coming our way in our daily lives as we live out the COVID-19 endemic safely.

Let’s be together and we will achieve!
