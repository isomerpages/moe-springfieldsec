<h1>Global Education Programme </h1>
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>At Springfield Secondary, the <strong>Global Education Programme</strong> is
anchored in our belief that students should be equipped not only with strong
academic foundations, but also with the global competencies necessary to
thrive in an interconnected world.</p>
<p>Framed by our guiding philosophy of <strong>“Local Roots, Global Wings”</strong>,
the programme aims to nurture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Global awareness<br></strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural competence<br></strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empathy and resilience<br></strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidence in engaging with global issues<br></strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through our <strong>Spiral Progression Framework</strong>, students are
progressively exposed to local and international perspectives, enabling
them to become compassionate, responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to a global society.</p>
