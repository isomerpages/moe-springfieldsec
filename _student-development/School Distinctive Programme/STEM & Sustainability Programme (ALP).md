<h1><strong>STEM &amp; Sustainability Programme (ALP)</strong></h1>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Springfield’s distinctive programme
that incorporates various areas in the Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics (STEM) field. Through problem-based learning and authentic
experiences in the Science and Food laboratories, we aim to develop our
students to innovate and think critically as well as creatively, while
gaining a deeper understanding in the subjects. The ALP curriculum consists
of real-world projects and learning journeys to provide students the opportunity
to apply their knowledge and think beyond the scope of the school.</p>

<p>Our programme caters to students of varying interest levels by allowing
a tiered system of experiential learning. Throughout their years in secondary
school, students will be exposed to experiences from Tier 1 and Tier 2
minimally (see diagram below).</p>

<p>Our foundation programme for Secondary 1 students centers around personal
choices to lead a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle through proper
health and nutrition. Students learn the essential skills in maintaining
a healthy diet such as reading nutrition labels and swapping out ingredients
in recipes to make dishes healthier.</p>
<p>This programme culminates in a milestone project where students design
their own healthy recipes and attempt to cook and plate their healthy dishes.
Students are also required to create eye-catching posters to market their
creations to their fellow peers.</p>
<p>An overview of the Tier 1 Foundation Programme for Secondary 1:</p>

</div>
<p>Our foundation programme for Secondary 2 offers a more self-directed and
independent experience for the students. Students are presented with a
real-world scenario of ensuring food security amidst land-scarce Singapore.
They are given the opportunity to plant their own vegetables in school,
harvest and cook them as part of our signature ‘Farm-to-Table’ experience
held at the end of the school year.</p>
<p>Similarly, students are tasked with a milestone project where they design
a prototype for a vertical farming set-up that can be included in the school
with minimal landscape use.</p>

<p><strong><u>Opportunities for authentic application of knowledge through Outdoor Learning Experiences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to visit industry partners to augment
their learning experience as part of the ALP journey. This aims to promote
and encourage healthy and sustainable living among the students, and at
the same time create an awareness of the potential job prospects in these
industries.</p>
<p>This year, the Secondary Two students visited three local urban farms
that are currently providing sustainable solutions to farming and food
security.</p>
