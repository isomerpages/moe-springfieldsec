<h1>Our Co-Curriculum</h1>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, we believe that <strong>learning extends beyond the classroom</strong> and
that every student can <em>STRIDE</em> forward in <strong>character, competence, and confidence</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Co-Curriculum is thoughtfully designed to reflect these beliefs, empowering
every Springfielder to thrive across diverse domains through the lens of <strong>Positive Education (Pos Ed).</strong> From
the structure of our programmes to the way they are delivered, Pos Ed principles
undergird all that we do – cultivating strengths, fostering meaningful
relationships, and inspiring purpose in every experience.</p>
<p>Springfielders are empowered to grow through the following domains:</p>

<p><strong><u>Five Domains of Springfield’s Co-Curriculum</u></strong>
</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>1.</strong> &nbsp; <strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)</strong></h4>
<p>In CCAs, Springfielders explore their interests and passions, while building
character through teamwork, discipline, and creative expression whether
on the sports field, in the arts, within uniformed groups, or through clubs
and societies.</p>
<h4><strong>2.</strong> &nbsp; <strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong></h4>
<p>Our CCE curriculum draws closely from MOE’s CCE 2021 syllabus, thoughtfully
adapted to meet the profiles and needs of our Springfielders. Through CCE
and Values-In-Action (VIA), students engage in authentic learning experiences
that nurture empathy and empower them to make meaningful contributions
to the community.</p>
<h4><br><strong>3.</strong> &nbsp; <strong>Student Well-Being</strong></h4>
<p>Our tiered Student Well-Being Framework ensures every student feels safe,
supported, and connected. More than just care, it equips Springfielders
with essential socio-emotional competencies and life skills (e.g., goal-setting,
emotional regulation, help-seeking, and digital literacy) to reach key
developmental milestones and maximise their potential.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Student Management</strong></h4>
<p>Our student management approach combines clear expectations with restorative
practices to nurture a strong sense of responsibility, reflection, and
respect - essential qualities for personal integrity and community living.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Student Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>We believe every Springfielder can lead with confidence. Our Student Leadership
programme is anchored in the Kouzes and Posner Leadership Challenge Model.
Through authentic platforms, Springfielders learn to influence others positively
and lead with purpose and care.</p>
