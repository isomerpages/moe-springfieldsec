<h1>Student Well-Being</h1>
<p>At Springfield Secondary, <strong>student well-being is at the heart of all we do</strong>.
Our tiered Student Well-Being Framework ensures that every Springfielder
feels safe, supported, and connected. More than just pastoral care, it
is a developmental approach that equips students with vital socio-emotional
competencies and life skills to thrive in school and beyond.</p>
<p>Our broad-based programmes support the holistic development of all Springfielders,
while additional higher-tiered support is available for students with specialised
needs, including those related to mental health and learning differences.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Springfield’s Signature Programmes to Support Student Well-Being</u></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>1. Start-It-Right</strong></h4>
<p>The Start-It-Right (SIR) Programme is a signature initiative tailored
to provide Springfielders with a <strong>holistic and purposeful start to the academic year</strong>.
Designed to be progressively structured from Secondary 1 to 5, SIR supports
students’ smooth transition by addressing multiple domains of growth —
including academic readiness, digital literacy, classroom culture, and
personal, emotional, and social well-being.</p>
<p>Through experiential, hands-on activities, students:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Participate in class-bonding experience</strong>s that promote
positive relationships and a supportive classroom culture;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage in routines and practices</strong> that cultivate productive
habits and a strong sense of personal responsibility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop essential life competencies such as teamwork, communication, and
adaptability through <strong>engaging activities and games</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Highlights from our 2025 Sec 1 SIR Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>For our Secondary 1 students, SIR marks their very first experience as
Springfielders, and is intentionally designed to be a warm, inclusive,
and memorable welcome into our school community.</p>
<p>Student leaders play a central role in co-designing and facilitating the
experience, guiding their juniors through activities, sharing stories,
and modelling Springfield values in action. These authentic interactions
lay the foundation for positive peer relationships and a strong sense of
belonging.</p>
<p>The SIR experience for Sec 1s culminates in a joyful and meaningful Campfire
Night, where parents are invited to witness the growth and bonds their
children have formed, as well as to enjoy performances the classes have
worked hard to put together.</p>
<p><u>A Strong Start for All Levels</u>
</p>
<p>Guided by their Form Teachers, students at every level co-create class
norms, establish a shared identity, and begin the year with clarity and
confidence. The SIR programme sets the tone for a school year where every
Springfielder is empowered to grow in character, confidence, and connection
- right from day one.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Make-It-Matter Days</strong></h4>
<p>Held at the start of each term, Make-It-Matter Days are intentionally
designed to help <strong>Springfielders re-centre, refocus, and begin each new chapter of learning with clarity and purpose</strong>.
These days empower students to make each moment count, reinforcing the
idea that their actions and growth truly matter. Anchored in Socio-Emotional
Learning (SEL), the sessions emphasize core school values and key 21st
Century Competencies, motivating students to take greater ownership of
their personal growth and learning journey.</p>
<p>While each Make-It-Matter session is customized to the unique needs, strengths,
and developmental priorities of each cohort, common features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Target-setting and reflection</strong> sessions to help students
set clear goals and recognise their growth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Addresses by School Leaders or Year Heads</strong> to reinforce
key values and provide motivation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lessons on Positive Education, CCE or ECG</strong>, tailored to
help students navigate life’s challenges; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Activities that strengthen self-management and resilience</strong>,
empowering students to take greater ownership of their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>3. End-of-Semester Reflections</strong></h4>
<p>At the end of every Semester, <strong>End-of-Semester Reflections</strong> encourage
students to pause, take stock, and celebrate how far they’ve come. Spread
across two milestone points – <strong>Midway Milestones (end of Semester 1)</strong> and <strong>Finish Strong (end of Semester 2)</strong> –
the programme nurtures reflective, appreciative learners.</p>
<p>End-of-Semester reflections are time for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Guided reflections</strong> that help students surface insights,
express gratitude, and recognise people and moments that shaped their journey;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Celebratory activities </strong>that honour achievements and affirm
Springfielders’ values and effort. These set a forward-looking tone, reinforce
belonging, and inspire students for the next phase; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parent-Teacher-Student Conferences </strong>allowing for students,
parents, and teachers to reflect together on academic and personal development
to strengthen home-school collaboration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Additional Support for Student Needs</h3>
<p>At Springfield, we provide a range of programmes and support initiatives
to help students overcome learning barriers and reach their full academic
potential. The focus is on early and intentional support to address learning
gaps or social-emotional difficulties. To do so, the school equips students
with the skills and strategies to help students build resilience, improve
self-regulation, develop positive relationships, and have confidence.</p>
<p>The need for additional support may be raised by students or parents directly
to teachers, or teachers may also suggest this to parents if they observe
any concerns about a student.</p>
<p>We adopt a tiered system of support in triaging student needs and the
level of support to be provided. This ensures students receive support
that is proportionate to their level of need, allowing the school to intervene
early and more effectively. The support can take various forms, such as
small group sessions, individual counselling, targeted academic coaching,
or social-emotional learning programmes.</p>
