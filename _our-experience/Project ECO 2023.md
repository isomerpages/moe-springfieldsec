Our Environment Ambassadors has made us proud again, clinching the Gold Award at the inaugural Project E.C.O. organised by the National Environment Agency! <br>

The team of four Secondary 2 &amp; 3 students underwent training on recycling and waste management before assessing our school's strategies and suggesting improvements. <br>

Their dedication &amp; hard work shone through as they competed against 58 teams. In recognition of their efforts, a virtual prize ceremony was held during the Environment Education Advisors Networking Session, where the school received the prize from Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, Mr Baey Yam Keng.

Congratulations to our Springfield eco-warriors and a big thank you for making a difference to our school!
