**F) First Day of School in 2023**

![](/images/MTP3.png)

•	All students will be engaged in the Start-it-Right Programme (SIR) for the first week of the school term. (See schedule below under SIR section).

**G) Start-it-Right (SIR) & CCA Orientation Programme 2023**

<u>Start-it-Right (SIR) Activities</u>

The SIR is a unique programme designed and customised by the school to provide a holistic and purposeful transition for the Sec 1 cohort to secondary school. The students will undergo a series of hands-on, team-based, and interactive outdoor activities such as dragon boating and cycling as they learn to build positive bonds, develop good habits & routines and strengthen their personal competencies. The students also work closely with the Class Form Teacher to forge a class identity and establish positive peer relationships. 

Parents/guardians are invited to school on 6th January (Friday), 5.15pm to 7.30pm as we round up the SIR programme with the Principal’s address and the campfire segment where your child/ward will come together as a class to exhibit their teamwork through performance.

Please refer to a separate message sent via PG for the briefing to parents on the outdoor activities that your child/ward will be going through.

<u>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Immersion Activities </u>

CCA play an integral role in the holistic growth and character development of each student. It also serves as a platform for skills acquisition and nurturing of talents. Through CCA, students will contribute actively to the school in key aspects of student leadership, school representation and community-based service-learning activities. The CCA immersion activities will serve to provide an overview of the CCA programme in Springfield and enable the students to be self-directed, interest driven and informed with regard to their CCA selection & participation. 

<u>SIR & CCA Immersion Schedule (3rd to 6th January 2023)</u>

These services ensure the protection of your child’s health and early detection of health issues. We appreciate your partnership with HPB to give our children a healthier start in life. 
 
b.	Your consent is needed to ensure your child receives these important health and dental services provided. You may access the Child Consent Portal via the link https://childconsent.hpb.gov.sg/.

**Safe Management Measures: Exercising Social Responsibility**

We would like to seek the cooperation of parents/guardians to impress upon your child/ward on the following matters with regard to exercising social responsibility: 

1.	Staying away when unwell or if family/household members are unwell: students and staff should be reminded to remain at home if they are feeling unwell with any COVID symptoms (e.g. fever, runny nose, cough, loss of smell). 
2.	Wipe Down Routines: All students will wipe down their desk areas and common/shared equipment each time they need to move to a different classroom/venue. 
3.	Reinforcing good habits: Staff will remind students to continue washing their hands with soap and water regularly, with hand sanitisers topped up in learning spaces around the school, including classrooms, for staff and students to use. Parents/guardians can also remind their child/ward to continue to wash hands frequently at home, ensure good ventilation in the house, use serving spoons while during meal times.

**Safe Management Measures: Visits to Schools by Parents/Guardians**
1.	Students should be accompanied by at most one parent/guardian. 

2.	Please note that visitors who are unwell will not be allowed to enter the school. We appreciate your patience and understanding to comply with the security checks.

3.	Visitors are not required to be fully vaccinated or show valid PET result so long as their visits are transient in nature with no sustained interactions with students. This includes visitors for parent-teacher meetings.

4.	To prevent over-crowding, parents should visit the school by appointment or during the stipulated operating hours of the school bookshop for the purchase of books and uniforms.
