**General Information for parents and students** 

Dear Parents/Guardians,

A warm welcome to Springfield Secondary School! We would like to take the opportunity to congratulate your child/ward on arriving at yet another milestone in their life as they progress from primary to secondary school.

You might be wondering what secondary life would be like for your child/ward and about his/her transition and adjustment to the different environment and routines. To allay your concerns and address some of your queries regarding your child/ward’s transition to Secondary 1, we have curated the relevant information and resources in this letter, School Website and Parents’ Gateway Portal. 

We look forward in partnering you in the holistic development of your child/ward.
