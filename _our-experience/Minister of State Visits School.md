Springfield Secondary is delighted to host a visit from Minister of State (MOS) Gan Siow Huang, accompanied by Superintendent Mdm Sarah Leong, on 27 March 2025. The visit provided an invaluable opportunity to showcase the school's commitment to innovative teaching practices, student engagement, and environmental sustainability.
 
The Minister of State, with the Superintendent present, observed lessons, and engaged in meaningful dialogues with both teachers and students. These conversations highlighted the dynamic learning environment fostered at Springfield Secondary, where students are encouraged to think critically and apply their knowledge in real-world contexts.
 
A key highlight of the visit was a tour of the school's Eco-Garden. This student-led initiative demonstrates the school's dedication to environmental education and sustainable practices. The Minister of State and Superintendent were impressed by the students' passion and knowledge in cultivating a thriving ecosystem within the school grounds.
