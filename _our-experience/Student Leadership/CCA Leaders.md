### Who are the CCA leaders?

CCA leaders form an integral part of student leaders in Springfield Secondary. They are responsible for providing visionary leadership in the CCA in terms of setting and achieving goals, while leading the CCA in the planning and execution of meetings, camps and activities. CCA leaders are expected to carry out their duties with commitment, integrity and responsibility in order to bring their beloved CCA to greater heights.

### Selection process:

In Secondary 2, potential CCA leaders will be nominated across all four CCA groups comprising of physical sports, uniformed groups, performing arts and clubs &amp; societies.  These students will then undergo an intensive leadership training camp known as the CCA Leaders Camp which will look to uncover their potential, strengthen their leadership qualities and push their boundaries.

### CCA Leaders Camp

Through various training throughout the year, the CCA Leaders will be equipped with skills that will allow them to be effective leaders in their own CCA. The CCA Leaders Camp is an annual leadership training camp that is organized for the secondary 2 CCA Leaders by the secondary 3 CCA Leaders. This student-led camp aims to consolidate the learning that Secondary 2 CCA Leaders have obtained over the year and prepare them for their final project/task in the following year that will see them being involved in the execution of a school event. This student-led camp aims to imbue the very qualities expected of a Springfield student leader â€“ one who embodies the five leadership practices and is a role model for fellow Springfielders to follow.

By the time these Secondary 2 CCA Leaders go into Secondary 3, they would have been equipped with the relevant skills to help or influence themselves, their peers and their community. At Secondary 3, these CCA Leaders will then be fully ready to take on the mantle of leadership in their own CCA when their Secondary 4 seniors step down in Term 2. 

### Springfield Carnival

To culminate their leadership journey in the school, Sec 3 CCA Leaders plan, organise and facilitate the lower secondary games carnival. It was a school level event that requires the CCA Leaders to demonstrate the key leadership practices such as model the way and inspire a shared vision. The event was successfully executed and received positive feedback from staff and students.
