# **Football Feats Unlocked!**

A big shoutout to our football team for their outstanding performance, securing 3rd runner-up in League 2! Congratulations to our players for their hard work and determination—here’s to more victories ahead! ⚽🏆

The school’s football team’s tenacity and drive were on full display throughout this year’s National School Games season, with our C Division Boys finishing strong as the 3rd runner-up in the League 2 Championships.

The journey to this achievement was no easy game — it was marked by blood, sweat, and tears. Under the steady guidance of their coach, the players honed their teamwork, skills, and tactics, constantly redefining their limits on and off the field.

The season tested their endurance and resolve, but their determination never wavered. Despite the obstacles, the team kept their eye on the ball, consistently putting in the effort needed to achieve their goals. Their hard work paid off, culminating in a commendable performance at the National School Games.

A special shoutout to our “12th player” — the fans — whose unwavering support both during matches and beyond the sidelines truly helped us score big. Your cheers and encouragement were the winning play that drove the team to success!

Congratulations to our football team on this well-deserved achievement—we can’t wait to see you back on the pitch next year! ⚽🏆
