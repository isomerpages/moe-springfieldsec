**D) Student Administrative Matters**

•	All students entering Secondary One in January 2025 will be issued with a new Secondary Level School Smart Card (SSC). While waiting for their Secondary level SSCs to be ready, Secondary One students can continue to use their Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel till end April 2025. Students can still purchase the Monthly Concession Pass using their Primary level SSCs, but they would need to pay  the Secondary School students’ fare.

•	Photograph taking in Springfield’s school uniform would be arranged for all students in January 2025. As such, students need not take their own photographs for submission to the school. 


**E) School Administrative Matters**

•	The school gate will close at 7.30am daily for flag raising. Vehicles will not be allowed access to the school after 7.30am. Parents/ Guardians may drop off your child/ ward at public carparks, located adjacent to the school.

•	Students who report to school after 7.30am are required to register at the Security Post.


•	For the safety and security of our students, parents/ guardians will have to leave the school premises once you have dropped off your child/ ward. If you would like to   meet up with relevant school personnel, you are requested to make prior appointments.  



**F) First Day of School in 2025**

•	The school term for 2025 will begin on Thursday 2nd January 2025.

![](/images/sir2025.png)

•	All students will be engaged in the Start-it-Right Programme (SIR) for the first week(s) of the school term. Refer to the  schedule below under the SIR section.

**G) Start-it-Right (SIR) &amp; CCA Orientation Programme 2025**

<u>Start-it-Right (SIR) Activities</u>

The SIR is a unique programme designed and customised by the school to provide a holistic and purposeful transition for the Secondary 1 cohort to secondary school. The students will undergo a series of hands-on, team-based, and interactive activities such as human foosball, archery tag and team-bonding activities to build positive bonds, develop good habits &amp; routines and strengthen their personal competencies. The students will also work closely with the Class Form Teachers to forge class identity and establish positive peer relationships, setting a good start to Positive Education through class and cohort engagement. 

Parents/ guardians are invited to school on <b>7th January (Tuesday), 3.30pm to 7.00pm</b> as we round up the SIR programme with briefings on Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) and Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), the Principal’s address and the campfire segment where your child/ ward will join their class performance  to exhibit their teamwork .

Please refer to the separate message sent via PG for the briefing to parents/ guardians on the outdoor activities that your child/ ward will be going through.

<u>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Immersion Activities </u>

CCA plays an integral role in the holistic growth and character development of each student. It also serves as a platform for skills acquisition and nurturing of talents. Through CCA, students will contribute actively to the school in key aspects of student leadership, school representation and community-based service-learning activities. The CCA immersion activities provide an overview of the CCA programme in Springfield and enable the students to be self-directed, interest driven and informed with regard to their CCA selection &amp; participation. 

<u>SIR &amp; CCA Immersion Schedule (2nd to 7th January 2025)</u>

<i>Note: More details on CCA days and timings will be made known to your child / ward during the CCA briefing session.</i>

<b><u>Annex A</u></b>

**Safe Management Measures: Exercising Social Responsibility**

We would like to seek the cooperation of parents/ guardians to impress the following matters upon your child/ ward with regard to exercising social responsibility: 

- <b>Stay away when unwell or if family/ household members are unwell</b>: students and staff should be reminded to remain at home if they are feeling unwell with any flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, runny nose, cough). 
- <b>Reinforcing good habits</b>: Staff will remind students to continue washing their hands with soap and water regularly, with hand sanitisers topped up in learning spaces around the school, including classrooms, for staff and students to use. Parents/ guardians can also remind their child/ ward to continue to wash hands frequently at home, ensure good ventilation in the house, use serving spoons during meal times.


**Safe Management Measures: Visits to Schools by Parents/Guardians**
- Please note that visitors who are unwell will not be allowed to enter the school. We appreciate your patience and understanding to comply with the security checks.

-	To prevent over-crowding, parents/ guardians should visit the school by appointment or during the stipulated operating hours of the school bookshop for the purchase of books and uniforms.
