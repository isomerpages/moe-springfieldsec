On 17 November 2024, our dedicated Environment Ambassadors and teachers from the EcoSTEM Committee proudly represented Springfield Secondary School at the Tampines 4Rs Exhibition held at Our Tampines Hub (OTH). This meaningful event aimed to promote sustainable practices, such as composting and urban farming, and encouraged residents to integrate eco-friendly habits into their daily lives.

The exhibition was graced by the Advisers to Tampines GRC GROs, Minister Masagos Zulkifli, Mayor Desmond Choo and Dr Charlene Chen, 2nd Advisor to Tampines GRC GROs. They actively participated in engaging, hands-on activities led by our passionate Environment Ambassadors and EcoSTEM teachers, Mrs Jenny Yoong and Miss Michelle Chew.
