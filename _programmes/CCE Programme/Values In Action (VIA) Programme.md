Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge, and skills. VIA fosters ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

VIA is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). VIA implementation is done so using the head, hands and heart approach as shown in Diagram 1.

When engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their own learning and arrive at a deeper understanding of issues. When engaging the “Heart”, students should emotionally connect to one another; have a sense of belonging to the class and in turn to the school, which in turn helps to cultivate a love for the nation. When engaging the “Hands”, students should make use of opportunities to give back to their school, community, and society, and realise that everyone can become leaders in one way or another. This is in line
with Springfield Secondary School’s Mission: “Lifelong learners, exemplary leaders”.

**Diagram 1**

VIA, however, takes a more student-centric, values-driven approach where students reflect on the values they have put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. This is made possible by structured classroom programmes in preparing the student and having post-activity reflections to reinforce learning. VIA thus helps students to internalise the values. VIA thus focuses on the “Head”, “Hands” and “Heart”.

Every year, for the class-based VIA, students need to fulfill a **minimum 10-hours** **requirement to align with LEAPS 2.0 (Through class-based, CCA-based, and own** **involvement)**. However, the focus is on quality learning rather than completing the number of hours. This involvement is compulsory for each student to help them achieve a comprehensive and holistic learning experience.

In Springfield Secondary School, we have a structured 4 to 5 years programme that develops the relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes to put values into action. The programmes are aligned with the school values and follow the **3R** approach: **Ready**, **Render** and **Reflect**.

| Stage 	| Ready / Render / Reflect 	| What the stage refers to 	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| Stage 1 	| Ready 	| Project Planning & Preparation (Identifying learning goals) 	|
| Stage 2 	| Render 	| Project Implementation (Conscious Learning) 	|
|  Stage 3 	| Reflect  	| Post-Project Implementation (Reinforcing Learning)  	|

Students from Secondary 1 to 5 will go through a structured VIA programme which will bring them through stages 1, 2 and 3 as stated above.

The school values are **Graciousness, Responsibility, Resilience, Diligence,** and **Integrity**. Every student in Springfield Secondary will take part in activities which will emphasise on all 5 values. However, for each level, there will be a special elevated focus on one particular school value. The breakdown is shown below:

| Level 	| School Value 	| How VIA projects will incorporate our school values 	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	|
|  Secondary 1 	|  Graciousness 	| The Secondary 1 students will focus on **kindness** projects with the self, the class, and the school as the focus using the 3Rs.<br> 	|
|  Secondary 2 	|  Responsibility 	| The Secondary 2 students will focus on **environmental** projects with the class, the school, and the community, as the focus by using the 3Rs. 	|
|  Secondary 3 	|  Resilience  	| The Secondary 3 students will focus on **community-centered** projects as the focus by using the 3Rs. Classes will work collaboratively and may initiate projects with the community.<br>  	|
|  Secondary 4 & 5  	|  Diligence & Integrity 	| The Secondary 4 & 5 students will plan and execute social entrepreneurship projects with the aim of raising funds for the school and/or the community. 	|
