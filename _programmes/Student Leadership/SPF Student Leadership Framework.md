# **SPF STUDENT LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK – The ‘1-5’ Model**

At Springfield, we focus on the holistic development of every Springfielder through a variety of programmes and activities. Such programmes and activities have been specifically designed to cater to the unique needs of our students with the goal of meeting the 4 CCE Student Outcomes[\[1\]](https://springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/student-leadership#_ptoh_14318). Our school focus “Developing the Leader in You” is achieved through the opportunities provided to every student to excel.

We accomplish this through The ‘1-5’ Model:

1.  Vision  
2.  Forms of Programmes  
3.  Leadership Values  
4.  Tiers of Leadership  
5.  Leadership Challenges  
    

### 1. VISION

One Vision for Student Leadership in Springfield is “Developing the Leader in You”. And it is with this vision in mind that we plan programmes that allow all students to have the opportunities to lead in one way or another. We believe that the programmes can develop our students to be responsible, civic-minded and gracious students, in line with our Strategic Thrust 2 and subsequently carry this ethic with them in their lives as lifelong learners and useful citizens, in line with our school Mission.  

### 2. FORMS OF PROGRAMMES

To prepare the Springfielders for their respective leadership roles, 2 forms of leadership training programmes are provided to meet general and specific needs:  

*   Cohort (Level or School-based)  
*   Focus Group (Specific groups)  
   
Two tables, Table 1 and Table 2, listing the 2 forms of Leadership Training Programmes in Springfield can be found Annex 1

### 3. CRITICAL LEADERSHIP TRAITS

At Springfield, we focus on 3 leadership traits which we help to develop in our students because we believe these traits are keys to meeting the 4 CCE Student Outcomes. The 3 traits are:

*   **Character** – Character fuels many of the attributes that students need to possess in order to become a great leader. A lack of character will erode a leader’s credibility and they might lose the respect of their peers, eventually leading to the possibility that their friends may no longer want to follow them.  
    
*   **Vision** – Leaders must be able to champion the vision of the school, provide clear direction for their peers, and at the same time, enthuse and motivate others towards the vision.  
    
*   **Passion** – Passion fuels the desire for excellence.  This pursuit for excellence stems from the drive to proactively work well and taking the initiative to surpass previous standards of excellence.  

### 4. TIERS OF LEADERSHIP

The 4 Tiers of Student Leadership delineates the levels of development the Student Leaders are at and subsequently determines the type of training and opportunities that will be provided for them. The definitions of the different posts within the Tiers of Student Leadership can be found in Table 3 in Annex 1.

### 5. LEADERSHIP PRACTICES<sub>[2]</sub>

The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® from Kouzes and Posner resulted from an intensive research project to determine the leadership competencies that are essential to getting extraordinary things done in organizations. The school decided to adopt the Leadership Challenge Model because of the way it helps develop the 3 critical leadership traits <sub>[3]</sub> recognised by Springfield through the 5 Leadership Practices and its provision of a tool <sub>[4]</sub> to assess the learning of our students.  

The Student Leadership Practices Inventory (SLPI) was developed based on case studies of over 3 million leaders about their personal best experiences as leaders. Content analysis of these case studies suggested a pattern of behaviours and actions used by people when they are most effective as leaders, The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

*   Model the Way  
*   Inspire a Shared Vision  
*   Challenge the Process  
*   Enable Others to Act 
*   Encourage the Heart  
    
All Student Executive Committee members are invited to participate in the SLPI which involves self and peer evaluations as part of the Observers' Test. They will also ask their teachers to fill in a supervisors' test. This will ensure a 360-degree feedback and measurement for the leaders.

Using the SLPI as basis, the school has developed their own assessment tool which will be used by the general student population. The results will then be recorded in the students’ ePortfolio in the school’s online portal.
