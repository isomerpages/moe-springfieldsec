### Who are the CCA leaders?

CCA leaders form an integral part of student leaders in Springfield Secondary. They are responsible for providing visionary leadership in the CCA in terms of setting and achieving goals, while leading the CCA in the planning and execution of meetings, camps and activities. CCA leaders are expected to carry out their duties with commitment, integrity and responsibility in order to bring their beloved CCA to greater heights.

### Selection process:

In Secondary 2, potential CCA leaders will be nominated across all four CCA groups comprising of physical sports, uniformed groups, performing arts and clubs & societies.  These students will then undergo an intensive leadership training camp known as the CCA Leaders Camp which will look to uncover their potential, strengthen their leadership qualities and push their boundaries. From this new pool of CCA leaders, outstanding candidates will then be selected as Student Executive Committee members.

### CCA Leaders Camp

The CCA Leaders Camp is an intensive leadership training camp held during the June Holidays every year. Organised and executed by Secondary 3 Resilience Camp participants, this student-led camp aims to imbue the very qualities expected of a Springfield student leader – one who embodies the five leadership practices and is a role model for fellow Springfielders to follow.
