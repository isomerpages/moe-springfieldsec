# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Springfield's distinctive programme that aims to ignite the interest and passion of our students in various Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields with a focus in the domains of Health Science and Sports Science.  

### Vision for ALP

Better Health for a Better Tomorrow  

### Objectives

1.  Enhance students' awareness on how to stay healthy and fit
2.  Develop students to be self-directed learners as they take the initiative to explore and construct knowledge based on their learning and experiences
3.  Provide a platform to imbue design thinking and a maker's culture with an authentic setting for students to connect and apply what they have learnt during lessons to the real world
4.  Ignite student's interest in STEM so that they may pursue a post-secondary course in the area of Health Science and Sports Sciences

The Applied Learning Programme covers three domains of Health: Physical Health, Nutrition and Mental Health.

  

### Tier 1 Programme

**For ALL Secondary 1 and 2 students**

**Physical Health Domain**

Students learn to assess their own health and fitness status by measuring their blood pressure using the Blood Pressure monitor, measure their percentage body fat and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) to understand better how these impact their health. They also learn more about how they can stay healthy and fit through regular exercices. To promote this to the entire school cohort, the School collaborates with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and launches its own SFSS Step Challenge.
