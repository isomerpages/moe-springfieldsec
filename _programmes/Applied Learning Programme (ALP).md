# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is Springfieldâ€™s distinctive programme that incorporates various areas in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field. Through problem-based learning and authentic experiences in the Science and Food laboratories, we aim to develop our students to innovate and think critically as well as creatively, while gaining a deeper understanding in the subjects. The ALP curriculum consists of real-world projects and learning journeys to provide students the opportunity to apply their knowledge and think beyond the scope of the school.

Our programme caters to students of varying interest levels by allowing a tiered system of experiential learning. Throughout their years in secondary school, students will be exposed to experiences from Tier 1 and Tier 2 minimally (see diagram below).

**Tier 1 Foundation Programme: Secondary 1**

Our foundation programme for Secondary 1 students centers around personal choices to lead a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle through proper health and nutrition. Students learn the essential skills in maintaining a healthy diet such as reading nutrition labels and swapping out ingredients in recipes to make dishes healthier.

This programme culminates in a milestone project where students design their own healthy recipes and attempt to cook and plate their healthy dishes. Students are also required to create eye-catching posters to market their creations to their fellow peers.

### Vision for ALP

Better Health for a Better Tomorrow  

### Objectives

1.  Enhance students' awareness on how to stay healthy and fit
2.  Develop students to be self-directed learners as they take the initiative to explore and construct knowledge based on their learning and experiences
3.  Provide a platform to imbue design thinking and a maker's culture with an authentic setting for students to connect and apply what they have learnt during lessons to the real world
4.  Ignite student's interest in STEM so that they may pursue a post-secondary course in the area of Health Science and Sports Sciences

 
### ALP Framework

The Applied Learning Programme covers three domains of Health: Physical Health, Nutrition and Mental Health.

  

### Tier 1 Programme

**For ALL Secondary 1 and 2 students**

**Physical Health Domain**

Students learn to assess their own health and fitness status by measuring their blood pressure using the Blood Pressure monitor, measure their percentage body fat and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) to understand better how these impact their health. They also learn more about how they can stay healthy and fit through regular exercices. To promote this to the entire school cohort, the School collaborates with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and launches its own SFSS Step Challenge.

Students learn how to:    
1\. measure their blood pressure;    
2\. measure their body fat composition and     
3\. calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI)

**SFSS Step Challenge**

The school collaborates with the Health Promotion Board to launch its own SFSS Step Challenge. This helps to promote a more active lifestyle among our students by encouraging them to take more steps daily. Students use the HPB's Healthy 365 mobile application to sync and update their step count.

**Nutrition and Health**

A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects a person against many chronic non-communicable diseases, such diabetes, heart diseases and cancer. It is important to eat a variety of foods, consume less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats to ensure a healthy diet. During the course of the programme, students learn about what makes a healthy diet. They learn about the different types of nutrients, calories in foods and how to use the Nutrition Calculator mobile applications to calculate the nutrients in a meal. They also learn about the effects of high sugar intake in one's diet and carried out tests to investigate the sugar content in some common drinks like Bubble Tea. To encourage students to have healthier food options and snacks, students learn how to make healthier, high fibre energy bars and healthier sports drinks. Through these activities, students have a better understanding of the importance of a balanced diet to stay healthy.

**Mental Health**
The programme segment on Mental Health helps students have a better understanding of good mental health and how they can be mentally and emotionally healthy. They learnt how to handle stress better and build mental resilience. Students were also taught how they can use different types of music to help them relax and reduce stress, and how sleep has a great impact not only on a person's physical health but also mental health.

**Project Work & ALP Showcase**

Students apply the knowledge that they have acquired through their ALP journey in the projects that they work on during the course of the programme. These projects focus on any one of the health domains learnt, either on physical health, nutrition and health or mental health. Students share their project work at the ALP Showcase at the end of the School Term.
