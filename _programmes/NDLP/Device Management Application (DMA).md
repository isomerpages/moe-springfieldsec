# **Device Management Application (DMA)**

Students PLD has been installed with a DMA to provide a safer digital environment for learning.

For in-school use of the PLD, the following DMA settings will be in place as a default: 

*   MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out social media sites, pornography, gambling, extremist and violence-related sites - PLD usage time will be set to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. 
*   The school will determine the apps and programmes to be installed to support teaching and learning 
*   A parent/guardian account will be enabled to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities and partner the school to ensure his/her cyber well-being 

For the DMA settings after school hours, parents/guardians can choose from the following options:                    

1.  Default: MOE/school DMA settings will continue after school hours    
2.  Option A: Parents can modify DMA settings after school hours           
3.  Option B: Parents can disable the DMA after school hours

Parents can request to change your choice of After-School DMA Options. Note that changes to the After-School DMA Options will be collated on the **1st** and **3rd Fridays** of each month and will only take effect in the following week.
