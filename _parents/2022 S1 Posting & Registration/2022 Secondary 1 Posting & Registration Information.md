# **2022 Secondary 1 Posting & Registration Information**

##### Welcome!

Dear Parents,

Congratulations!   

Your child has arrived at yet another milestone in their life! We welcome you as he/she moves from Primary to Secondary School.   

You might wonder what secondary school life will be like, and how he or she will adjust to the different environment and routines. It might also be an anxious feeling as the start of the secondary school journey draws near.   

The information provided here and the online resources via the School Website and Parent Gateway Portal will address the relevant concerns and queries regarding the transition to Secondary School. The school will help your child to be prepared for the change and adapt well to secondary school life – and parents can play a part to help them be prepared too!

**A**    **Administrative Information**

*   Students and parents are **not required** to physically report to the school on the next working day (23 December 2021) following the release of S1 Posting Results.  ·
