# **Travel Declaration for Students**
  
Dear Parent/Guardian,  
  
Please note Travel Declaration is only required if your child/ward **_intends to travel_** for the June Holidays.

A **NIL** return is not required.  

#### For Parents / Guardian with Parent Gateway Access

To make your travel declaration, go to \[SERVICE > DECLARE TRAVELS\]. Please declare your child/ward's travel plan(s), indicating both the country and city of travel, and any city of transit, _by 21st May 2021 (Friday)_. Only one parent is required to declare.  
  

#### For Parents / Guardian without Parent Gateway Access

You may print the hardcopy declaration ([_**Appendix 2**_ ](/files/Appendix%202%20-%20Hardcopy%20Letter%20to%20Parents%20and%20Guardians%20Not%20Using%20PG%20-June%202021.pdf)), complete the relevant information and submit via your child/ward Form Teacher.  
  
_When planning your travel, please refer to the attached advisory on travelling ([**Appendix 3**](/files/Appendix%203%20-%20Advisory%20on%20Travel.pdf)). If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school directly rather than through Parents' Gateway (PG).  
  
Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
