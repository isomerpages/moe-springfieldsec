The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme aims to equip Springfielders with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enable them to cope with change, adapt and make informed education and career choices. This is achieved through an integration of Career Education lessons, Study Skills techniques, Learning Journeys to tertiary institutions and industries, School Careers Fair and a pilot Work Experience Programme.
