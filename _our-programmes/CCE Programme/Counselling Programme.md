# **Counselling Programme**

### Dedicated to your Emotional &amp; Mental Well-being

Every life has its challenges. We run into deep, sharp corners and slippery roads in the course of our everyday living. And when those challenges seem overwhelming, help is just around the corner. Taking the feelings with friends, family, or your form teachers can make you feel better â€“ but many times you need the guidance and help of the school experienced professional counsellors.

### Vision Statement

"Our purpose is to provide an environment that stimulates growth in the students, for them to be responsible, resilient and resourceful, hence leading them towards personal wellbeing in the aspect of cognitive, social, emotional, physical and mental."
