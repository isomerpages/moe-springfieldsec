If you encounter any issues with your PLD - Chromebook,  
  
* Quick fix – do a Restart   
* If issue persists **_AFTER_** you have done a Restart to your PLD - Chromebook, please do inform your Form Teacher and fill in a mandatory Fault Reporting Form [**_HERE_**](https://bit.ly/3ujNA8f). (_Do ensure that you capture the fault or issue you face with your PLD - Chromebook_).  
  
Upon receiving your form submission, we will then contact and advise you accordingly. We may need you to come to School to send in your faulty PLD - Chromebook for us to do a 1st level of Troubleshooting.  
  
If we are unable to solve the issue in School, we will need to retain your PLD - Chromebook for further checking. A spare Chromebook (_subject to availability_) will be loaned out to you while your PLD - Chromebook is sent for repair/service.
