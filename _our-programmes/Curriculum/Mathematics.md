#### Making Learning Relevant


***Kite Design and Flying: Sec 3 (2022)***

An interdisciplinary collaboration with the Science Department, we want the students to learn Mathematics and Science concepts through this activity. The students learnt about the forces acting on the kite and the properties of the shapes used for the kite.

#### Alternative assessments

***Math Trail: Sec 1 (2023)***

The Trail builds confidence in students’ ability to recall and use their knowledge gained from lessons. It also gave them authentic learning experiences through combining students’ understanding, experiences and reasoning.

***Statistics Learning Experience: Sec 2 (2022)***

Statistics is a branch of Mathematics that deals with collection, organization, presentation, computation and interpretation of data. In the Mathematics syllabus, it is important for students to understand and be able to interpret given data. Thus this activity made the learning of Statistics alive.

***Inquiry Based Learning: Sec 3 (2023)***

To enhance students’ problem solving skill and enable them to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, the Secondary 3 went through Inquiry Based Learning. The task consists of 2 parts; first part is to investigating the MacDonald’s Golden Arches can be modelled by any quadratic equation and the second part is to design a rollercoaster using cubic functions.

***Mathematics Learning Day: Sec 1 to 3 (2023)***

Students in Springfield Secondary School are engaged in a termly programme by the Mathematics Department: Mathematics Learning Day. <br><br>
In Term 1, our students embarked on a journey into the realms of <b>Numbers and Algebra</b>. They dived into the world of cryptography by deciphering the Caesar Shift Cipher Encryption Technique within the confines of a virtual escape room concept. Moreover, students honed their problem-solving skills using the ROT3 method as part of their escape room experience.

In Term 3, a remarkable collaboration between the <b>Mathematics and Science Departments</b>. This time, the students were transported into a Titanic-themed mixed reality game which revolved around the second strand of our Mathematics syllabus: <b>Geometry and Measurement</b>. This engaging adventure saw students exploring various sections of the ‘Titanic’ while tackling mathematical challenges linked to the math concepts. Furthermore, the STEM Playground Challenge added an exciting element to this ‘Titanic’ adventure. Students were awarded materials based on their correct answers to the challenges. These materials were used to construct boats capable of supporting a 100g weight. These inventive creations were captured on video and submitted for the STEM Playground Challenge 2 and Springfield Secondary is one of the winning schools for this challenge.
