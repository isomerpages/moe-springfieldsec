<h3>Programmes</h3>
<p>The department runs six main programmes that have been planned in stages
so as to cover the four/five years that a Springfielder will spend in school
before graduation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Social and Emotinal Learning</strong>
<br>Social and Emotional Learning is taught through the conduct of SDE Activities
and/or Pastoral Care Lessons which contribute towards the holistic development
of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social
domains. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education</strong>
<br>Sexuality education is an important programme in our schools. It aims
to help our young understand the physiological, social and emotional changes
they experience as they mature, develop healthy relationships with the
opposite gender and to teach them how to make responsible choices. It is
premised on the importance of the heterosexual married family as the basic
unit of society, and respect for the values and beliefs of the different
ethnic and religious communities on sexuality issues.
<br>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Education &amp; Career Guidance</strong>
<br>The Education &amp; Career Guidance Programme aims to provide Springfielders
with the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to make good and informed
decisions about post-Secondary education, training and employment options.
This is done through promoting career awareness and equipping Springfielders
with the skills in gathering and making decisions on educational and career
options. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
<br>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
Through CW education in CCE, students learn to be respectful, safe and
responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating
for the good of the community online. It involves an understanding of the
risks of harmful online behaviours, an awareness of how to protect oneself
and other Internet users from such behaviours. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Involvement</strong>
<br>The school involves students in community service to fulfil its responsibilities
to the community and to encourage the spirit of volunteerism in all Springfielders.
Every Springfielder is encouraged to go beyond the required minimum six
hours of community service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Counselling</strong>
<br>Counselling aims to help Springfielders with problems to reach beneficial
solutions. Teacher-Student Conferencing is a proactive approach adopted
by the school to enable teachers and students to build rapport and for
teachers to identify students who need help, at an early stage.</p>
