# **Applied Learning Module (ApLM) Programme**

### Rationale

1. To extend and build on the learning objectives of existing Normal course subjects through applied learning; 
2.	To introduce students to possible course of study in Post Secondary Educational Institutions; and
3. To expose students to possible career paths.

**Approach**
<br>i. Learning by doing
<br>When students learn by doing, they are engaged in hands-on, experiential learning. In doing so, there is greater engagement in the learning process and this results in deeper learning for students as they see connections between theory and practice.  
<br>ii. Learning about the real world
<br>Providing students with rich opportunities to acquire and apply knowledge and skills in real-world contexts helps to deepen their learning. This also allows them to see the relevance of their learning, which aids in developing motivation and a sense of purpose in our students.

iii. Learning for life
<br>Through ‘Learning by doing’ and ‘Learning about the real world’, students will  appreciate  the  complexities  of  reality  and  experience  the  need  to imagine possibilities, take risks, try something new or different, and learn from challenges and setbacks when things do not work according to plan or theory. These are attitudes and dispositions which they can continue to apply as lifelong learners.
