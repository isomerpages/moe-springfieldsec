# **Direct School Admission**
  

**1\. Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise**

The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004 to promote
holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse
range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school. Under
this DSA-Sec Exercise, participating schools will be able to select Primary Six (P6)
students for admission to Secondary One. The selection will be based on their
achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)
results are released.

**2\. School Vision**

Springfield’s school vision is **_“Lifelong Learners, Exemplary Leaders”_**. In Springfield,
we believe in providing our students with opportunities to develop their sporting talent,
leadership and creativity, along with school representation. Our DSA talent areas of
Rockwall climbing, Floorball, Taekwondo and STEM provide the platforms for our
students to achieve these.

**(a)&nbsp;Rockwall Climbing**  

The Springfield rock wall is an outstanding Tampines landmark that has captured the
attention of many passing by. Built in 1995, it was one of the first outdoor rockwalls in a
secondary school. Over the years, thousands of our students have learnt the basics of
rockwall climbing through our Physical Education (PE) Programme, and many have
excelled in the sport. Our climbers have always been recognized as the rugged and
robust students in the school. Rockwall climbing develop mental strength and inculcate
qualities such as integrity, resilience, and perseverance.

In Springfield’s PE Programme, Lower Secondary students are equipped with the basic
knowledge, skills, and confidence in rockwall climbing; climbing, rope ascending and
abseiling. They will learn to appreciate the rigour of the sport and the intrinsic value of
climbing. With the opportunity to participate, students can be engaged in self-discovery
and cultivation of values. Secondary 2 students will also be given the opportunity to
attain the Singapore National Climbing Standard Rockwall Climbing Certification Level I.

  

**(b) Floorball**

  

This sport was introduced in Springfield in 2007 as many Springfielders had displayed
talent and interest. With the passion and support from the teachers, the School was
able to achieve significant results. The team is now known for their all-round skills,
teamwork, and resilience.

Participation in competitions such as the National School Games play a vital role in
providing our students with opportunities to develop their technical skillsets and qualities
such as leadership, teamwork and resilience. At Springfield, our floorball students also
organize **Springfield Blast!**, - our very own an annual inter-school floorball competition.
Through this platform, students develop other competencies such as organizational
skills, and different aspects of leadership skills and teamwork, that complement the
skills that they need in the court. Such holistic development grooms our students to be
well-rounded individuals who are grounded in values.

**(c) Taekwondo**

Springfield’s Taekwondo (TKD) Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programme supports and
reinforces the interests and abilities of students. Students are involved in various
competitions, training camps, community involvement projects and leadership training.
Grading assessment is also integrated into the CCA to promote rigour and
professionalism. Aesthetics-based activities like Taekwondo Aerobics is included in the
programme to provide students with exposure to a greater range of experiences and
activities as well. The TKD CCA programme serves to inculcate values and imbue in
students the desired outcomes of education.

With the introduction of Taekwondo in the National School Games in 2009, Springfield
Taekwondo was provided with greater scope for involvement and achievements.
Participating students are given participation opportunities that range from team display
to sparring categories. Participation in competitions help students to develop mental
strength, focus and resilience.

**(d) STEM**

Springfield’s Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programme focuses on **STEMpowering lifelong learners and exemplary leaders with STEMpathy**. Through problem-based learning and authentic STEM experiences, we aim to ignite curiosity and enable our students to appreciate the relevance of their learning beyond the classroom. We develop our students to make connections and apply their creativity, communicate effectively and work collaboratively, and actively contribute to the community and society, so as to make a positive difference to the lives of others. 

At Springfield, we **inspire** the interest in STEM in all students through our Applied Learning Programme, which is focused on Health and Food Science, as well as a STEM integrated IP Curriculum and transdisciplinary, real-world STEM-related projects. Students subsequently **aspire** to deepen their interest and gain further exposure via in-house programmes like STEMania, and national programmes like STEM Playground. 

Students who apply through DSA will be given opportunities to **excel** in the area of STEM and further their passion and skillsets through learning journeys, work attachments and internships to STEM-related organisations for opportunities to apply their knowledge and gain greater awareness of the range of STEM-related job opportunities and industries. They will also be able to join  our EcoSTEM Club CCA, and participate in STEM research programmes and national competitions with mentorship from our teachers and Pathfinders in relevant STEM-related organisations and agencies.
