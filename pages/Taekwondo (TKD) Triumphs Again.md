Dedication and sweat paid off for the school's taekwondo team at the National School Games. Months of grueling training fueled their success, with the girls securing an impressive 2nd place and the boys finishing a strong 3rd in their respective B divisions. 

Training sessions were a testament to their perseverance. Students pushed themselves through rigorous drills, honing their kicks, blocks, and stances. Coaches tirelessly guided them, fostering not just physical prowess but also mental fortitude. 

The **team spirit** was undeniable, as students cheered each other on and celebrated individual victories knowing they contributed to the collective goal. This combined effort culminated in their well-deserved podium finishes at the National School Games, a display of their unwavering commitment and the culmination of countless hours of practice.

Once again, heartiest congratulations to our TKD team! 🌟⭐️
