<p>The <strong>Animation and Game Making (AGM) Competition</strong> is a prestigious
annual national event organised by the <strong>Computer Education Unit</strong> for
secondary school students offering <em>Computer Applications (CPA)</em>.
It provides an exciting platform for students to showcase their creativity,
technical skills, and passion for digital media and game design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year’s competition drew <strong>67 submissions</strong> from schools
across Singapore, all vying for top honours in categories judged on creativity,
animation quality, and programming excellence. The theme for the <strong>Secondary 3 Game Category</strong> was <strong>“Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Us”</strong>,
inspiring students to explore how technology and humanity intersect through
imaginative gameplay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are <strong>immensely proud to celebrate our very own Ly Nguyen Minh Thu</strong>,
who has emerged as <strong>one of only seven Gold Award winners</strong> in
this national competition! Her perseverance, optimism, and innovative spirit
exemplify the <strong>Springfield resilience</strong> and creativity that
we deeply value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Congratulations, Minh, on this outstanding achievement and for flying
the Springfield flag high on the national stage!</p>
