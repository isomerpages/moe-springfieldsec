<p>The National Digital Literacy Programme was launched in March 2020 and
is intended to equip all Secondary Students with digital literacies across
the 4 components: Find, Think, Apply and Create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the NDLP, students will own personal learning devices (PLD) that
will enable them to learn effectively through ICT mediated activities.
The device will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised
learning. Support will be given to ensure that no child is denied of this
opportunity. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to
pay for the PLD.</p>
<p>Springfield Secondary is scheduled for Phase 1 implementation and the
non-graduating students in Secondary 1, 2 and 3 have received the PLD in
Term 2, 2021.</p>
<h3>Intended Outcome</h3>
<p>There are&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;intended outcomes of the 1:1 personalized
learning environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will</p>
<p><em>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; Support the development of digital literacies, where students will learn digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information online, interacting with the online community, and creating digital products.</em>
</p>
<p><em>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; Support self-directed and collaborative learning, where students can access digital resources on their own to acquire knowledge about a topic of their interest beyond the curriculum. They can also share and build on one another's ideas, and refine their own understanding.</em>
</p>
<p><em>3)&nbsp; &nbsp; Enhance Teaching &amp; Learning. 1:1 learning environment allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching. For example, instructions, activities and feedback for each student could be more tailored and relevant to students' learning needs.</em>

<h3>Springfield Digital Learning Vision</h3>

</div>
<p>At Springfield Secondary School, your child will be using PLD for active
learning in all subjects, including the conduct, completion &amp; submission
of authentic learning/inquiry tasks that require research, digital creation
and collaborative learning.</p>
<p>The students will also be embarking on a series of self-paced New Media
Literacies lessons on the Student Learning Space (SLS), with facilitated
discussions on cyber wellness, key digital skills and literacies by teachers.</p>

<p>The device that the students will be purchasing is intended for Teaching
&amp; Learning purposes, and device affordability for all students is one
of the considerations.</p>
<p>The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your child's Edusave account,
after setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous
fees.</p>
<p>To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a one-time Edusave top-up
of $200 in April 2020 to support the purchase of the device. This is on
top of the annual $290 credited into the Edusave account for Secondary
School students. Most Singapore Citizen students would have sufficient
funds in the Edusave account after the top-up. Should the Edusave funds
be insufficient, cash out-of-pocket would be kept low.</p>
<p>For students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, subsidies are available
even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will
be $0.</p>
<p>Additional subsidies are available for students who need financial assistance,
and that parents should approach the school for more information.</p>
<h3>Supporting Students in the Responsible Use of the Devices</h3>
<p>The school has in place some measures to enable a safe and seamless learning
environment for students. The role of the parent is also key in partnering
the school to support your child.</p>
