<h1><strong>Counselling Programme</strong></h1>
<h3>Dedicated to your Emotional &amp; Mental Well-being</h3>
<p>Every life has its challenges. We run into deep, sharp corners and slippery
roads in the course of our everyday living. And when those challenges seem
overwhelming, help is just around the corner. Taking the feelings with
friends, family, or your form teachers can make you feel better – but many
times you need the guidance and help of the school experienced professional
counsellors.</p>
<h3>Vision Statement</h3>
<p>Our purpose is to provide an environment that stimulates growth in the
students, for them to be responsible, resilient and resourceful, hence
leading them towards personal wellbeing in the aspect of cognitive, social,
emotional, physical and mental.</p>
