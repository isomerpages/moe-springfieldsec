# **Global Education Programme**

### Rationale

1\. Internationalisation fund is given to schools so that each Singaporean child would have the opportunity during his/her schooling years to immerse in the culture of another country.    
  
2\. Hence, the conceptualisation of this Global Education Program is to educate our students to have a global outlook and perspective of the world. This is to prepare our students to be future relevant and culturally aware.

### Learning Approach

CCE’s Head, Heart, Hands Approach is used as Global Education Program’s Learning Approach.  

**_Head:_**  
The program allows our students to learn many things about themselves and the country they are visiting. They learn to collaborate, to respect fellow schoolmates and foreign friends, develop leadership abilities and public speaking. They learn independently using ICT initiatives as they adapt to different living and studying conditions overseas. They will also have a greater awareness of another country's culture and education system.

**_Heart:_**      
The program gives opportunities to our students to care for their schoolmates, teachers, and foreign friends by working together and exhibiting the right school values (Graciousness, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, and Diligence).  

**_Hands:_**     
The program allows our students to make a difference to their schoolmates and teachers by helping them, and to their foreign friends, through the conduct of service-learning activities. The program also serves as a training platform for students to hone their leadership skills; both self, and peer.

  

#### Target Group and Programme Details

The Secondary 3 cohort is the target group.  
  
In line with holistic education, we will look at the overall development of the student before the student disqualifies himself or herself. There are 3 main areas in which we would focus on; academics, CCA, and behaviour. Each student is expected to minimally pass their mid-year examination and attain and attendance of at least 75% in their respective CCA. The student's conduct is generally expected to be good and will be corroborated by the Year Head and Form Teacher.  
  
The purpose and pre-requisites of this programme serve to motivate the students to manage themselves and work towards a goal. Essentially, we hope that students will be spurred on to strive for academic success, display genuine enthusiasm for their CCA by attending it regularly, and learn to conduct themselves in the best possible manner by practising sound self-management.
