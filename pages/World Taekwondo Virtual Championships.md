# **World Taekwondo Virtual Championships**

The inaugural World Taekwondo Virtual Championships took place in Singapore on November 16-17, 2024, with over 120 athletes from 23 countries and Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) participating. The competition featured three age categories: mixed junior (ages 13-15), mixed adult (36+), and male, female, and mixed young adult (ages 16-35). This event highlights the growth of Virtual Taekwondo, a non-contact sparring discipline using the AXIS motion-tracking system and virtual reality headsets.

On the first day of competition, Singaporeâ€™s Javis Yap from Springfield Secondary School made headlines by clinching the junior mixed title, defeating compatriot Alexander Khor in two rounds. Javis, also the poster boy for the event, was celebrated for his victory.

The discipline was featured in the 2023 Olympic Esports Series and will also be showcased at Paris 2024, ahead of the first Olympic Esports Games in 2025.

In line with our Springfield Value of Resilience, Javis displayed hardwork and positive attitude in preparing for this competition. It was not an easy journey as he suffered an injury during the National Schools Games this year. We look forward to seeing him in action in upcoming competitions and do Springfield proud!
