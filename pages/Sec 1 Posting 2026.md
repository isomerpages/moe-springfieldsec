<h1>Sec 1 Posting 2026</h1>
<p>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Springfield Secondary School! We would like to take
the opportunity to congratulate your child/ ward on reaching another milestone
in their life as they progress from primary to secondary school.</p>
<p>The information shared here will help you to better prepare your child/
ward for his/ her transition to Secondary One. We will also be using Parents
Gateway as a communication platform with parents, and strongly encourage
parents to register for an account if you do not have one yet. (Instructions
on registering for Parents Gateway can be found at <a href="https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/parents-gateway/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.springfieldsec.moe.edu.sg/parents-gateway/</a>.)</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering you in the holistic development of your
child/ ward.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>A. General Information for Parents/Guardians</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students and parents/ guardians are not required to physically report
to school on 22nd December 2025 (the next working day following the release
of Sec 1 Posting Results). There is no registration necessary as your child/
ward has been posted to the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will use the School Website and Parents Gateway (PG) to share
information for the incoming Secondary One cohort with parents/ guardians.
(For parents/ guardians who do not have access to PG yet, we will be contacting
you via email.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child’s/ ward’s class will be shared with you via Parents Gateway
on the first day of school. This information will also be shared with your
child/ ward when he/ she reports on the first day of school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to report to school and be at the assembly area (i.e. school
hall, concourse or classrooms) by 7.30am. Students who report to school
after 7.30am may be considered late and are required to report to the student
management team or register at the Security Post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school gates will close at 7.30am daily for flag raising, and vehicles
will not be allowed access to the school after 7.30am. Parents/ Guardians
arriving after 7.30am should drop your child/ ward off at the nearby public
carparks (located adjacent or opposite to the school) so as not to block
traffic along the main road.</p>
