<h4><strong>Device Management Application (DMA)</strong></h4>
<p>An MOE Device Management Application has been installed on all students’
PLDs. The DMA provides a safer digital environment for learning and supports
both the school and parents in guiding students’ device use.</p>

<p><strong><u>In School Settings, 6.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m.</u></strong>

<p>During school hours, default DMA settings apply:</p>
