##### Championing Character and Leadership
The Student Council (SC) is dedicated to fostering a community where character and leadership flourish. We strive to cultivate an environment where every student can reach their fullest potential, empowering them to embrace challenges, learn continuously, and lead with integrity in both their academic pursuits and personal endeavors.


##### Empowering Student Representatives
The SC comprises students selected by a panel of teachers who identifies the most qualified candidates to serve on the SC. These individuals demonstrate not only academic excellence but also strong leadership qualities, integrity, and a genuine commitment to serving their peers and the school community. Together, we organize and manage school events and activities, fostering a vibrant school culture and enhancing student welfare.

Some of the activities that the SC have planned are:

Rice to the Occasion is an annual event organized by Temasek Junior College, Bedok Youth Network and South East CDC. This year, Springfield Student Councillors initiated the collaboration and applied their leadership skills and knowledge that they have learned. They displayed confidence and empathy in their interaction with the various stakeholders and seniors. The interaction with the seniors is a key component of the service learning event that embodies the spirit of community service and fosters meaningful connections between the Student Councillors and the wider community.
