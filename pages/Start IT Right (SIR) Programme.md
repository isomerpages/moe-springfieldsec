<h3>Start-IT-Right (SIR) Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 to 3: 2 January to 7 January 2025<br>Secondary 4 to 5: 2 January to 10 January 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>The SIR is a unique programme designed and customised to provide the students
with a holistic and purposeful embarkation for the new academic year. It
will cover major components of academic learning, information technology
engagement, positive classroom culture and personal, emotional &amp; social
well-being. The students will undergo a series of hands-on, team-based
and interactive activities as they learn to build positive bonds, develop
good habits &amp; routines and strengthen their personal competencies.
The students will work closely with the Class Form Teachers to forge a
class identity, set daily norms and establish positive peer relationships.
For the Sec 1 cohort, the outdoor learning activities will also be incorporated
in the SIR to support the students moving into a new learning environment.</p>
