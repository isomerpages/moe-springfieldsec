<h3>Start-IT-Right (SIR) Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 to 3: 2 January to 7 January 2026<br>Secondary 4 to 5: 2 January to 9 January 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>The Start-It-Right (SIR) Programme is designed to provide students with
a holistic start to the new academic year. The programme supports students’
academic and digital learning, fosters a positive classroom culture, and
nurtures their personal, emotional, and social well-being.</p>
<p>Students will take part in a series of hands-on, team-based, and interactive
activities aimed at building identity, fostering positive peer relationships,
developing good habits and routines, and strengthening personal competencies.
They will also work closely with their Form Teachers to build a strong
class identity, establish daily norms, and nurture a supportive classroom
environment. For the Secondary 1 cohort, orientation activities will be
incorporated to facilitate a smooth transition into their new school setting.</p>
